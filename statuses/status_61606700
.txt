@PupDH depending on the weather my eyes are dark brown or black
@PupDH well fella I don't see how you look like lol so ….
@PupDH love eyes which are the complete opposite of mines :-) opposites do attract :-) @cosmicroo
@PupDH for me the most attractive part on a man is his eyes first and then their face … the rest not that important at all @cosmicroo
@PupDH type wise never sure but different, unique is always the best @cosmicroo
@PupDH pick any fetish club in london fella … when something like Laboratory (Berlin) comes here then we can talk :-)@cosmicroo
@PupDH a what?A proper fetish club and not a pretend dress up peoples club, and who?if he ever finds me I will let you know @cosmicroo
@PupDH as i said it will need to be something special or someone special to make me visit a fetish place again …but until then :)@cosmicroo
@cosmicroo stories no but some great sex for sure :-)
@PupDH lol fella I am sure I saw quite a few things more then you did in your sexual life :-) so doubt anything can offend me @cosmicroo
@PupDH thats cool and good to hear that friendly and fetish go into a same sentence lol@cosmicroo
@PupDH it would need to be something very special to make come ever again to a fetish place … as lost interest in it all @cosmicroo
@PupDH @cosmicroo cheers but prefer my experimenting to keep for myself and not to do it in public ....

@mancsrubber its all new to me even I am almost 2 years how I've been diagnosed but small changes are always there :-)
Well "stable" it is then :-) oh well undetectable I knew I would be but still miffed about CD4 as need to wait for a year for it .... HM
@PupGrowlie @11dantheman11 good for you as wondered when is that going to happen with a guy in every country of the world lol
@11DanTheMan11 @pupgrowlie porn company?!!!
@PupGrowlie @11dantheman11 going every three months? How much sex do you actually have?!
@PupGrowlie @11dantheman11 CD4 count is not a test to see if you are HIV +, its a test to see how healthy your immune system is as an HIV +
@11DanTheMan11 @pupgrowlie monthly almost £600 pounds goes out of m y salary for various taxes ... So do the numbers
@11DanTheMan11 @pupgrowlie we have public health in the UK so we pay for it through our numerous taxes
@livingmyposlife I am
Undetectable more then a year now but never heard the "stable" bit as yet
@11DanTheMan11 @pupgrowlie I don't feel comfortable with that as just always makes me think when I am ill is something going wrong ...
@PupGrowlie UK is going into oblivion really with these things so unless you are clinically unwell they don't do it anymore ....
NO I don't feel comfortable my CD4 count being checked once a year!!! Its not standard it's because you are cutting on everything !!!!
@11DanTheMan11 Saw I don't even classify as a horror movie really … again very big yawn to any type of movie similar to saw
@11DanTheMan11 paranormal activity 4 was S.H.I.T …… number 3 was the best but sadly the 5th part is out next year again - YAWN!!!
@11DanTheMan11 Insidious had many great parts … definitely the best horror movie of 2012
@11DanTheMan11 Loved insidious … Lovely Molly had scary parts? Where and when lol
@11DanTheMan11 the movie is rubbish on many levels … waste of money really
