@JadeMischner I was actually chuckling while writing that haha
@JadeMischner Speaking of which, there is now brown noise coming out of my bedroom.‚Ä¶ Which means it's time to sleep as it's past 4AM here:-)
@JadeMischner I used to call the fan noise white noise. Someone told me it's actually brown noise, which just sounds gross‚Ä¶
@JadeMischner I didn't know it did that. Me too, I always fall asleep listening to podcasts &amp; with a fan on for some slight background noise
@JadeMischner Yep mostly glamor. Another reason I considered Scotsdale since (for work) the stereotype is pretty accurate from what I gather
@JadeMischner I have a small car parts business &amp; a few affiliate programs but my header description on here pretty much sums up my day job

@JadeMischner I won't think about it. Lets change the subject‚Ä¶ :-) So what do you do in the dry heat of AZ?
@JadeMischner this is killing a little of my enthusiasm for considering getting the iMac 5K
@JadeMischner You're right. Apparently a couple of people already exchanged theirs but haven't said if it persists. I'll give it a few days
@JadeMischner nope, like turning on a music system and the loud pop if the volume is high. Just looked it up, I'm not the only one. Great
@JadeMischner ugh my iPad is making some loud popping noise from the speakers every now and then
@JadeMischner haha aw thanks:) I'm pretty familiar with F¬∞ though. Really? Celsius is ridiculously simple- 0¬∞ water freezes, 100¬∞ it boils.
@JadeMischner damn you!!!! :(
@JadeMischner  I know what you mean. I was in Malta this summer &amp; the humidity was torturous! Whereabouts in AZ are you?
@JadeMischner  I love how we have only just started talking and we are already talking about the weather‚Ä¶
@JadeMischner Wasn't fussy. Looked at houses everywhere from Phoenix/Scottsdale to places I've never heard of. ¬£ to $ offered flexibility
@JadeMischner Heat is heat as far as I'm concerned. Siri tells me its currently 57.2 degrees here &amp; 80.6 in Phoenix.
@JadeMischner But then got more work in London requiring me to physically be here. Prior to that, could work anywhere with Internet &amp; phone
@JadeMischner So cool or should I say so hot! I was  considering moving to AZ about a year ago. Almost got on a plane to go look at houses
@JadeMischner  Well, speaking of tourists‚Ä¶ Surprise surprise I went to Orlando. NY was cool, stayed in Times Square
@JadeMischner That's pretty cool. Yeah, I live about half an hour from all the tourist stuff.
@JadeMischner Nice:) Did that include UK? In the US, I've only been to FL, NY &amp; this year to New Orleans for wrestlemania (Sssh don't judge)

@RitaTeamXtreme Def got VIP but email says 2 jobbers. I'll wait for them to come in the post &amp; then I'll know for sure. Email is prob wrong
@RitaTeamXtreme But they've given  random like Big Show and Rey which I'm not going to. Screw that. Will prob sell my tix.
@RitaTeamXtreme Ok now I understand why. So, I didn't buy them separately because the VIP package said they were included.
@RitaTeamXtreme 2 questions pls. First, which package did you get (silver etc) &amp; did you buy Axxess meet &amp; greet separately? Thanks :)
@RitaTeamXtreme Thanks Rita! You're the best! I'll let you know as soon as I receive the pack or email :)
@RitaTeamXtreme I'll prob swap with someone once I'm there. I'd prefer Hogan.
@RitaTeamXtreme Yep. They don't reply. I'll give it another week. Thanks :) Hope I don't get Cena, though it seems he's being g given to VIP
@RitaTeamXtreme Nah no email. Prob because I got travel packages and it's all rolled into one bundle.
@RitaTeamXtreme Apparently, there is standard, VIP and Premium VIP, all of which have different people! With my luck I'll get bloody Cena :/
@RitaTeamXtreme Why is it pre-assigned?
