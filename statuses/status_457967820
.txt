Honestly I like Johnny Manziel but what about Teddy Bridgewater lol, he's waiting to get drafted too
@EnSaNiTy_ @JArmstrong65 @StevenChen2016 watch distance be the only ones having practice 😂😂
@JArmstrong65 we came in second in the 4x800, we dominated in the 1600, and idk about the 3200
@StevenChen2016 depends on how the throwers did, for your practice
I Ran a 5:47 mile today and @EnSaNiTy_ dominated those hurdles #TurnUp
I'm soooo fancy you already know
@a_tammaro27 @kylecanna fuck u
@a_tammaro27 such wow 
             Much funny
@a_tammaro27 true. That other kid's a goon
@a_tammaro27 who's that stud in your new avi?
First tweet from the iPad
@JArmstrong65 maybe..
@JArmstrong65 sì, jake ho fatto
@JArmstrong65 'twas a social network, i don't think anyone used that more than a week
Anyone remember when Path was a thing?.. For like 2 weeks
@JArmstrong65 :(
@JArmstrong65 yeah I don't care, but a like on my video wouldn't hurt
I still think the Polar Plunge is stupid, but I did it with the least of effort..
@CloydRivers @JArmstrong65 this tweet was made for @a_tammaro27
@EnSaNiTy_ why you gotta tweet this.?
@Mad_Dog_20 just to reiterate, tonight's game was bad on all levels, but I'm not giving an excuse staton the refs blew, it was a known fact
If there's anything I've realized tonight, it's that I'm the ugliest motherfucker ever while I'm running..
@Mad_Dog_20 it's a rivalry where bullshit is accepted by refs, and it could get a player hurt or the whole series affected..
@Mad_Dog_20 did you watch the game?
@Mad_Dog_20 I have to ask: you watched the game tonight correct? You made sure to wear glasses if so, right?
@EnSaNiTy_ you literally know less than a piece of sand about NHL hockey. Stop saying this "oh he's black bullshit"
@a_tammaro27 hey Subban.. http://t.co/1uxBOvRu9E
Counting the amount of missed calls that game... http://t.co/gmzzCqmrFz
@EnSaNiTy_ the cheapest you'll get one for is $57. I just bought the cheapest you can get
@EnSaNiTy_ why would you spend 170$ on a jersey when you don't even watch him play..?
Comeback. Starts. Now
@JoeMorris_11 or you're lucky
Justice served Subban. Keep cheap shotting and you'll be in the box a lot.

There's an app just for Lebron. I give up
@Mad_Dog_20 no it was jake and Elliot not understanding hockey kind of day
@EnSaNiTy_ because he did something stupid during the game that I hated, and he always backs down from fights and acts like a bitch
@Mad_Dog_20 explain..?
@JArmstrong65 @EnSaNiTy_ not one bit
@EnSaNiTy_ that's not why I hate him or why reasonable bruins (not racist asshole) fans hate him
@JArmstrong65 yep. Sure
