@Seagie85 @daverabbich Not enough hours in the day. Plus if it's something I have to learn, it's cheaper to outsource to an "expert"
@daverabbich Aye, so angry. The guy has admitted he's ripped it but is claiming his work adhere's to the brief. It does, but illegally /o\
@csscallum The dev who ripped the work illegally wants paying claiming he achieved the brief regardless. Just hope @Upwork see sense

@Webknit So the Conservatives could win, but Labour and smaller parties could team up and vote against a majority Conservative government
@Webknit If your head isn't spinning already, then have a look at a possible Labour minority government: http://t.co/q7GEH4ZzUk
@Webknit I've no idea. I don't think Labour will get enough to form a coalition with Lib Dems. SNP are going to play a massive role
@Webknit Indeed. Like in 2010 David Cameron was PM and Nick Clegg became deputy
@Webknit @davetgreen Sorry, that's the wrong link. http://t.co/LKJ6mqERwm
@Webknit @davetgreen might not be enough. Again the BBC has a fun tool/game to demonstrate how coalitions work: http://t.co/zpvpuLZte2
@Webknit @davetgreen They won't, so it relies on them to form a government with the next 3; Lib Dems, UKIP &amp; SNP. But teaming up still...
@Webknit @davetgreen That's the crucial thing for me, Labour said they won't but I don't trust them not to. Otherwise they'd get my vote
@Webknit @davetgreen I think either Labour will join SNP or Conservatives go with Lib Dems again
@teabass Interesting, I'm in a marginal seat and the importance in the area is felt. People are passionate, debating. http://t.co/KGtRoAtQ06
@Webknit @davetgreen The UK voting system is majorly flawed and should really be changed: http://t.co/qDdoUdPctr
@Webknit @davetgreen There would be more tactical voting instead. i.e. people voting for other parties to ensure their party won overall
@Webknit @davetgreen MPs can either motion for a vote of no confidence in the current gov or vote for a new general election

@bnwebdesign Twitter needs a "donate to hide" feature
@WebKnit "The value of 1em, when used in a MQ such as min-width: 20em, is unaffected by the font-size of the body element in most browsers."
@JamesHorncastle I'd possibly get offered some long odds on this but, a Balotelli loan move in Jan if Origi joins Liverpool, Inter into EL?
@WebKnit I don't think it's affected. If you declare the font-size on the body 60em in your mq is still 960px. I might need to experiment
@daniel_speight @Seagie85 Probability of automation: Transport and material moving = high, computing = low https://t.co/jFfDnQSiPm
@WebKnit Ironically em's haha. There are a few of little bugs like that which I'm ironing out in the next version
@WebKnit A px value to stop the website from getting "too wide". I'll be ditching that in my next version. Currently it's 1440px but changes
@WebKnit Oh, I use percentages for layout using my own grid system: https://t.co/LTMLaLI7Ge
@WebKnit Depends on the font characteristics but aiming for that magic 60‚Äì75 characters per line I find leads to easy to read content
@WebKnit My initial thought was if the user has said they prefer to read text at 18px, I'll leave &lt;p&gt; as that
@WebKnit My boilerplate becomes a little unstuck here as I'm at the mercy of what the designer has done so most of these values change
@WebKnit But it does mean to get a good solid base of styles which promotes readability and accessibility of content (I hope)
@WebKnit The more I look into typography its about scale/proportion for each element so for each breakpoint you can end up with a lot of CSS
@WebKnit I currently do this: https://t.co/LbcSJhh25c But I think I'll add more to each one e.g. lists, blockquotes etc.
@WebKnit (a semi-related interesting article I have bookmarked for reference)
@WebKnit aye, with responsive design I find myself declaring different font-sizes per breakpoint anyway. http://t.co/WrqJLY6gJG
@WebKnit font-size: 0.813rem (or em). That would be 13px for most but if the user increased the default to 20px it would be 16px for them
@WebKnit within their browser settings for accessibility purposes. That's why em's + rem's are perfect as their multiples of the users size
@WebKnit It's best not to declare a font-size on the body at all: http://t.co/vl3sY9BsVd. Also the user may specify their own font-size...

@migstopheles Indeed, this review by @lukaswhite shows a few more features I've yet to discover: http://t.co/hd39Rs2Ysj
@jamesduffell @brackets I took a look but couldn't justify the cost. Less is more when it comes to text editors for me
@robin_parker I tried it years ago when it first came out and wasn't that impressed but now it feels slick, bulletproof and rather pleasant
@tjcafferkey I've been using it for an hour and I already think it's better
.@brackets is winning me over so far. Some useful extensions I've found: Emmet (obvious), Extension Highlighter, Seti theme, PHP Syntax hint

@millard_ I used @AtomEditor quite a bit but then switched back to Sublime. No real reason, I was just more comfortable with Sublime
@NotRenton Apart from that it's not much of an update for me. Never experienced any of the crashes that have been fixed

@WebKnit I'm definitely going to upgrade. Although a Macbook with 256gb HDD and 1tb Dropbox storage does tickle me. Will need to manage that
@WebKnit Indeed, it's worth going pro now. I've been quite happy to bounce off my 9gb limit until now
@Seagie85 maybe not. I use my MacBook pro more than anything else but it's small and powerful and more useful than my iPad
@Seagie85 Desktop for pissing around at work. When laptops get lighter and more portable they might come back but with things like Surface 3
@Seagie85 Pretty much got laughed at but the most popular resolution on most sites is iPad portrait
