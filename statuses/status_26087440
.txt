#DogtownRedemption #MVFF38
One of the directors Chihiro Wimbush was there last night at the premier, author Meena Srinivasan, our neighbor Denise Zmekhol, producer.

Life really sucks when people don't have toilets. That is one key message of the film…

I highly recommend the film "Dogtown Redemption" playing at the #MVFF38.

@tayhatmaker white anarchists seem to be unable to follow lead of others in solidarity, perhaps because of their need to always not follow.
@tayhatmaker They should step back, listen, and follow the lead of POC organizers.
@tayhatmaker Not all anarcho-punks are like the ones who take over otherwise productive and inclusive protests, to be fair.
@tayhatmaker True, some of the people most likely to break things are agent provocateurs.
@tayhatmaker Their privilege to act out thoughtlessly endangers others, making protests less safe for the elderly and young people and POC.

@ScottEsposito Thanks you too.
@ScottEsposito Haha, yes, but the book isn't out yet? Beer and debates are always welcomed! Then in 2015 we can read it.
@ScottEsposito Yes.
@ScottEsposito In context it refers to entitled to "niceness" (or respect) online. That's the kind of entitled she probably means.
@ScottEsposito Most, not all. Unemployed Native Americans for example; very poor and hungry for example; rape survivors; trafficked people.
@ScottEsposito He sees a "yes-man culture" she says, because of who he is, assuming he doesn't see harassment. …we'd need to read the book.
@ScottEsposito He is entitled and privileged, nothing wrong with pointing that out. That doesn't mean he doesn't experience human suffering.
@ScottEsposito White male probs dominate. The world is way too focused on the probs of white males. We need to shift the dominant focus.
@ScottEsposito Yes, the book should be read first.
@ScottEsposito Who knows? That's not really her point or the simple point of the article.
@ScottEsposito Yes. I'm sure she's aware of that.
@ScottEsposito Everyone suffers. But there is a difference btwn 1st world probs of the privileged class vs probs of more exploited groups.
@ScottEsposito There's a difference between a shallow kind of niceness vs respect. I wonder if the book talks about respecting women and WOC
@ScottEsposito Are you saying she's not?
@ScottEsposito Probably so. She's trying to make a point about privilege. Her point shouldn't be quickly dismissed, like his book.
@ScottEsposito I assume she's only attacking the premise, to call attention to the frequency of rape and death threats women receive online.
@BrooklynBugle I will, thanks for suggesting it.

@astoehr Thanks for calling out the problems and what to expect. After hearing your POV, not sure I'll see it.
@astoehr Ew. Now I'm afraid to see it. So many cinephiles have recommended the film. Does it have any redeeming qualities?
I told Eimbcke it was really refreshing to see regular teenage bodies on screen, not emaciated actors trying to look like fashion models.
CLUB SANDWICH screens again on April 28th and May 4th. #SFIFF57
Parental love and the bittersweet goofy letting-go associated with launching a young person into adulthood was tangible in CLUB SANDWICH.
After CLUB SANDWICH Eimbcke talked about being the brave guardian of what a film asserts despite the conscious intentions of the director.
CLUB SANDWICH, Eimbcke's quiet film (much is communicated with little dialogue), screened today to a very appreciative audience at #SFIFF57
