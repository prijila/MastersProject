@StaggerLee30 I wish I could say the same for Dylan but in my eyes blood on the tracks, h61 BIABH BoB are 4 of the greatest ever albums!

@StaggerLee30 that's it finished the referees association have accepted and thanked the club for this
@StaggerLee30 employer would have done. It would have become public regardless, and they have not released a statement apologising...
@StaggerLee30 they had good reason to make the accusation as the player said he felt he was racially abused and they acted upon it as any...
@StaggerLee30 ferguson has never said sorry for his constant allegations of poor play/cheating on the part of referees
@StaggerLee30 I felt that they did apologise. They expressed with "regret" which is the best that they will do, not ideal but enough...
@StaggerLee30 I agree but they apologised so its water under the bridge, they defended a player and were wrong, that's all.
@StaggerLee30 constantly over the last few years, ie overbo, but I don't condone, there are worse examples, ie Liverpool Tshirt scandals etc
@StaggerLee30 it was in the heat of the moment and I can understand slightly from the clubs perspective who have been hindered by referees..

@nicolacarson94 @alanwallwin you won't get anything for 35mph you'll be sweet
@amandarobo I assume this was Alex haha
@amandarobo need to get back to getting that big arse spanked lolz :p
@StaggerLee30 worth a look, emylou Harris is on there As well and she has a great voice
@StaggerLee30 have you heard the cave/Ellison lawless soundtrack? Some great country/blues on there, brilliant album
@StaggerLee30 ill give you my opinions on these artists as a listen, expecting good things!
@StaggerLee30 don't blame you. Each to his own
@StaggerLee30 ever for me, Better than Lennon/jagger-Richards/young/cave etc #boldstatement
@StaggerLee30 the man released highway 61 blond on blond blood on the tracks BIABH, amongst others and all lyrically impeccable, greatest ..
@StaggerLee30 I agree the album is plagued by it but some great tracks again and i feel he has earned the right to be narcissistic...
@StaggerLee30 2012 is tempest by Dylan, I swear by the man, and although his voice leaves much to be deisred, roll on John is powerful.
@StaggerLee30 it'll take me a while to get through all of that! Ill look them all up, not crazy about dinosaur jr. Im afraid, my album of...
@StaggerLee30 a really great album, I saw him live and met him as well, he's rather fond of himself may I add
@StaggerLee30 josh t Pearson also, a bearded genius #lastofthecountrygentlemen
@StaggerLee30 will check them all out, bap Kennedy and drive by truckers also worth a look, bap was ex energy orchard frontman, great solo.
@StaggerLee30 my song of 2012 so far #stoneocoldclassic as you would say :-)
@StaggerLee30 ill be sure to check them out on that album listen to mating of the doves written from Jesus perspective but not religious...
@StaggerLee30 and on a separate note God Bless you Amigo - Felice Brothers is well worth a look, great album, pay what you wish as well.
@StaggerLee30 marred the result unquestionably
@StaggerLee30 nobody found out about jimmy saville? I'm joking but i feel aggrieved here, utd won to their credit but poor decisions...
@StaggerLee30 were hard done by
@StaggerLee30 third offside, Chelsea played well and I accept Ivan's red but Torres' was harsh, Chelsea scored two good goals and I feel...
@StaggerLee30 none they actually outplayed Chelsea, a total contrast to circumstances here, first goal was lucky, second pure class...
@StaggerLee30 I'm no conspiracy theorist and won't be beginning now but coincidence and luck only stretch so far
@StaggerLee30 how often have united been the Center of attention over referee preference
@StaggerLee30 was Hernandez offside?
@StaggerLee30 Chelsea had the momentum, united we're crumbling, did Torres deserve red? No way, ivan shows no malice, did Rooney on mata?
That was a disgrace, I'm not going to rant about cheating, everyone saw and can deduce as they like #deservedwin? #afraidnot
@StaggerLee30 can i use the buzz word and begin UCAS before we speak? just so that i can at least get the majority of it done soon.
