@ScotRail and I say this as on news it's reporting drivers aren't picking up Sunday shifts. Is this wrong? Hire more staff maybe?
@ScotRail people work on Sunday's. Nurses, Drs, shop assistant etc. Life goes on on  a Sunday. Get with the times&amp;get your staff to work.
@ScotRail so the already dismal Sunday service is getting worse. Train drivers should be ashamed of themselves, as should you.

@MezMerrett 😂 may damage car. No game. Shall just continue to be rude back to them. Take you as my inspiration!
@MezMerrett so my neighbourhood brats gave me the finger as I drove past today...I flipped them off back. Just thought you'd like that. 👍
@GillianAS ha ha that's true I still have my lists and your hen do book, I'll console myself with them.
Between my iPhone,iPad&amp;having to do most of my notes at work digitally, I realise I hardly hand write anything anymore.
This makes me sad. 😰

I rated How I Met Your Mother (2005–2014) 9/10  #IMDb http://t.co/8phbDm7sAq
I mean both sides by that btw. I realise a lot of passion is involved but I switch off when people start shoving their opinion in my face.
Had a sore head for days, that's only really lifting now, and #reportingscotland  isn't helping. I'm so by with #indyref shouting &amp; abuse.
On that subject what's with season 5 of HIMYM on @E4Tweets ? Skips from episode 6 to episode 8,and gets worse as the season progresses?😰
@NetflixUK can you please put #HIMYM seasons on UK Netflix. I'm trying to watch on @E4Tweets and they like to skip episodes! #prettyplease😔

Some angry, probably drugged, ned just picked up sticks and flung them at crows in a garden whilst shouting "die demons" #onlyinglasgow
@StuTurner not so much but thanks!
@StuTurner I know right.
It's back in a messy bun now. #inevitable work hair.
