@jarxdleto @moon_cake1 Off to lunch now here on the west coast. It was lovely chatting with you both! : )
@jarxdleto @moon_cake1 I meant same on the collapsing part. Lol which is odd cause I pride myself on my control of my emotions.
@jarxdleto @moon_cake1 Same...def get both the pleasure and the pain from seeing him.
@moon_cake1 @jarxdleto I'm a bit shy around celebs. Saw many when I lived in NYC but never thought of approaching them.
@jarxdleto @moon_cake1 LOL I seriously didn't believe she said that until I heard it with my own ears. I hope he knows most aren't like that
@jarxdleto @moon_cake1 me too...500 is still a lot. How many people do you think are in a typical VyRT chat?
@moon_cake1 @jarxdleto Because you're a sweetheart! &lt;3
@jarxdleto @moon_cake1 Me too...I've been checking on the number they sold selfishly kind of hoping it stays low.
@msyelyah @moon_cake1 @jarxdleto I'll do you one better, take care! : )
@moon_cake1 @jarxdleto @msyelyah We regular folks are beginning to "model" that reality. Just as gay people are getting marriage rights!
@moon_cake1 @jarxdleto @msyelyah Marriage is becoming an archaic institution. Celebs often don't get married cause they don't need to.
@jarxdleto @msyelyah @moon_cake1 It drives me nuts when he shares art sites &amp; the first response is I LOVE YOU JARED!!!
@jarxdleto @msyelyah @moon_cake1 and all that come to my country spam.
@jarxdleto @msyelyah @moon_cake1 agree that it would be nice if we could talk about music, art + film with him w/out a deluge of I LOVE YOU!
@jarxdleto @msyelyah @moon_cake1 I read where he said he gets that people are curious about the way he lives. I like that he gets it, but...
@msyelyah @moon_cake1 @jarxdleto Ohhhhh lol Well I've seen worse non music related convos than "is he married", but I get what you mean. : )
