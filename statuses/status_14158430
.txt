@WeMoCares The devices die like this regularly. At least 1 per week if not more.
@WeMoCares Anyway, I have reinstalled the app on the iPhone. Still the Wemo device remains dead. See http://t.co/pZoGZtWkih
@WeMoCares yes every time I have to turn them off manually. The devices themselves crash.
@WeMoCares They need to be manually powered on and off - they are locked up. No lights on.
@WeMoCares The point being this is not a problem with my handheld device. The sensor and Wemo swithces just crash and become unresponsive.
@WeMoCares Er irrelevant. The devices don't even respond when I press their on buttons. They have to be switched off/ on again at the socket
@WeMo seriously I'm getting annoying beyond belief about your devices. I have 5 which crash regularly. Firmware is up2date. What to do next?
4 out of my 5 #wemo sensors and devices crashed this week. Can anyone recommend an alternative?
