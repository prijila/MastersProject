@McDonalds that's the third time this month I've had to exit the line to get to work on time. Burger King wins.

@masirovitsm @Animaleyz of course. I'm not an idiot or an asshole. But there is an issue here that bothers me. She has no consequences
@DawgPound_DJ @Animaleyz @masirovitsm and I think in court he may be able to successfully argue self defense. That would be an uphill battle
@DawgPound_DJ @Animaleyz @masirovitsm I have no problem with both of them being arrested.
@DawgPound_DJ @Animaleyz @masirovitsm I just want to know why she wasn't arrested for throwing the first punch. She also kicked him before.
@DawgPound_DJ @Animaleyz truth.
@masirovitsm interesting you specify that only men shouldn't be allowed to hit women, yet women seem to be allowed to hit men. #Chauvinist
@DawgPound_DJ @Animaleyz I think there is room there for him to be found not guilty. I think he's trash though for not walking away.
@Animaleyz @DawgPound_DJ that's not something I saw.
@DawgPound_DJ @Animaleyz I agree, but I think she should have been arrested too. It's that simple.
@DawgPound_DJ @Animaleyz I don't think "relentless" should be the criteria. The very first punch should be.
@Crunk1977 she raised the hand to strike. He grabbed it to prevent the punch. That is actually taught in self defense.
@DawgPound_DJ @Animaleyz and neither is hitting a man. Hitting in general should be illegal. That is why I said they should arrest her.
@DawgPound_DJ @Animaleyz otherwise girls will think they can do anything without reprocusions
@DawgPound_DJ @Animaleyz if a girl punches me in the face I want the "right" to punch her back. I will never use that right, but I want it
@DawgPound_DJ @Animaleyz agreed. But being a coward is legal in all 50 states.
@DawgPound_DJ @Animaleyz don't get me wrong here. I would have beaten his ass if I had been there, but I think there is a valid legal debate
@DawgPound_DJ @Animaleyz she raised the hand to strike. He grabbed it to prevent the punch. That is actually taught in self defense.
@DawgPound_DJ @Animaleyz I also believe that the issue can be debated by grown men without resorting to name calling.
@DawgPound_DJ @Animaleyz on this I agree. But morality and legality are separate issues to me.
@zdubb78 I genuinely believe legally he should have the right to defend himself. Call me names on Twitter. Go ahead. I really care a lot.
@Animaleyz - I believe the law needs to be unbiased regarding gender. I do however think he should have kept his hands off of her.
So, I've watched this video of De'Andrea Johnson in the bar a few times now. He should have the legal right to defend himself. Arrest her.

@ClvlndK8 I keep meeting to tell you, great job w/ the Fan Phenom. You need to win this for us. I'm looking forward to hearing you everyday.
@JimWalker13 I think Bennet will develop into a good player. Noel will be a great one though. His upside is outrageous.
@JimWalker13 if you had to pick, Love or Wiggins...who do you want? I only want Love if LBJ returns. Otherwise, go with the youth movement
@JimWalker13 It really makes me wish we had drafted Nerlins Noel last year
@JimWalker13 whether we use him as an asset or a player, getting Wiggins in the draft was HUGE
@MLBGeek agreed! I want to buy a Wiggins jersey, but I am waiting to see if he plays here first.
@JimWalker13 whatever happens happens. It would be a tremendous boost to the city, but we are poised for success either way.

@ALawRadio any mention of LeBron's return still gets nothing but dirty looks for a lot of us. He'll always be a douche. But he can ball.

@CLETalkingHeads @andy_baskin they need to take a second QB in a later round too. We need to have more than one option for success.
@RealBenLynn @DawgPound_DJ it's not offense we need, it's a QB. The rest of the offense isn't far from being decent. Need RB, WR &amp; G
@RealBenLynn @DawgPound_DJ there is something to be said for drafting Jadeveon Clowney and Taj Boyd
@DawgPound_DJ @RealBenLynn Bortles is in the discussion, but I believe they need to pick the one they want and go get him at 2.
@RealBenLynn from the 20s? We don't have enough to compensate for that value. You should look up the draft value chart

Davone Bess just made Ladarius Webb look like Brandon Knight (thanks to Kyrie) at the Rising Stars game during All-Star Weekend last year
@Chico923TheFan if the offense could run a screen, the defense would be able to practice against it. Seems like a related problem.
@ClevlndsCapo21 @AnthonyLimaFAN it wouldn't have had us in the hunt for the #1 pick. But for them it does.
@ClevlndsCapo21 @AnthonyLimaFAN on some teams he would be.
@ClevlndsCapo21 @AnthonyLimaFAN at least Noel's inability to take the floor this year puts the 76ers in the hunt for Wiggins
@Sasa2455 you should do something about that.
Just because I mentioned Colt doesn't mean I want him anywhere near my team, @Chico923TheFan
@Chico923TheFan Colt McCoy couldn't make the screen work either. I question the O Line on this problem. The timing of a screen is tricky.
@ClevlndsCapo21 @AnthonyLimaFAN agreed; but so is his motor. I don't see a 1st overall pick here. I don't have an eye for NBA talent though.
@ClevlndsCapo21 @AnthonyLimaFAN a first overall pick as a project? His upside had better be unprecedented...
@Chico923TheFan how do we combat the blitz without an effective screen? This team hasn't been able to run a screen in years now.
@ClevlndsCapo21 @AnthonyLimaFAN there is a part of me that wants to criticize the pick, but I trust Chris Grant.
I'm watching last nights Cavs v Pacers game, and wondering what @AnthonyLimaFAN suggests I watch for in Bennett's game.
RT @espn: Ohio State might beat Purdue by triple digits...
@KenCarman the Browns could go 2-14, but if those 2 wins were against Baltimore I would be happy. Huge game. #FuckTheRatBirds #GoBrowns
So the OSU Buckeyes came out a bit slow. I'd like to see them pick it up a bit. #gaspedal #GoBucks

@KenCarman @ItsFillar what is this, a new propaganda campaign?
@CLETalkingHeads time to start calling Boston sports talk radio stations as the Clevelandian...
Be real @ItsFillar, the crumbs are obviously from a @KenCarman feeding frenzy.
@CLETalkingHeads you should clip together samples of the Bostonian's calls to make him say how much he loves the Browns/Indians/Cavs
@CLETalkingHeads what did you ban the Bostonian for?
@ScottCottos take the reigns off. You only live once.
@Andreas1O1 it was a fun game to watch. I think Browns will be very successful here again.
@CLETalkingHeads I think at attendance has been so good because of how fun the stadium improvements make the in game experience.
I wonder if anyone considered how bad it will sound when the Browns game has it's first media blackout in #WorstEnergyStadium
@CLETalkingHeads they introduced Kyrie as the captain on TV last night.

@CLETalkingHeads universities are not in the business of "providing" educations, they are in the business of "selling" them.
@CLETalkingHeads however, by being unmeasurable indirect revenue, only educated guesses or estimates are available to the decision makers.
@CLETalkingHeads therefore, it isn't a burden toward tuition, in every case. When it is, the sport should be cut.
@CLETalkingHeads nonrevenue producing (NRP) sports create unmeasurable indirect revenue through enrollment. It isnt necessarily unprofitable
