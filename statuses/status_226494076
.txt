As usual this will be a policy being enforced by a senior officer using it as an example in their annual PDR! Way to build moral well done!
How about they tell these 'offended communities' that they support their officers voicing, visually their support for fallen colleagues?
If the country's top police officers cannot find more pressing issues to deal with than a Velcro logo what hope do we have?#ThinBlueLine
Senior police officers deem the #thinblueline badge may be seen as offensive. Shows a lack of empathy &amp; common sense as usual.#police #COPS

@jb_1971 @TottenhamEdits then again your older going by your name so you would know better. I'm 31 and a touch outside remembering that team
@jb_1971 @TottenhamEdits no that's a different debate/opinion but mine is that Bale is far better than Hoddle and will improve further.
@MandaGroves nah not till August, talking about a shithouse tv program I'm watching. I need a flight to NY by the way.
@jb_1971 @TottenhamEdits different game from years ago. Other greats wouldn't have been fit enough to play today.
