@Searching1 I predict they will respond as any power faced w/ potential revolt/revolution they will increase force R act like they R chnging
@Searching1 in the past 'recognized practices' "Authority" protected the .5/1%; now they are losing legitimacy in the eyes of the public..
@Searching1 the power tactics R used hegemonically against the majority 99% &amp; by force against the minority 99%...[homeless, ethnic, races..
@Searching1 these elite use what has been accepted (legit authority) to write, interpret and apply law against the #99% to keep status quo..
@Searching1 what is happening is that Govt Power is being used by the socioeconomic elite (.5 of 1% of #US wealth is in a few families).
#JstMyOpnun #ExcessiveForce abuse is more than race. It's about rampant power of a militarizing State.  It's socioeconomic in root..
