Experiencing a painful reminder that, due to age, I have a lot less bounce off a icy parking lots. Moving a little slow today. :)
Goodbye 2012. You were a less than pleasant year at times. Can't say I'm sorry to see you go. Looking forward with hope to the year to come.
So thankful God works out all those petty details that I stress so hard over. We had a great Christmas Eve service. Now I can relax &amp; enjoy.
Thankful for a great worship service this morning. Thanks to some excellent musicians and beautiful kids. It was great celebration of Jesus.
This has been a VERY long day. Time to sleep so I can do it again tomorrow. Thankful for God's provision.
How did you spend your Friday night? I spent mine standing in poop cleaning someone's sewer. Good times...good times. :)
Any keyboard players out there who aren't already playing this Sunday. I am willing to pay you to play at RVCC this week. Need someone bad.
Enjoyed a weekend full of Christmas celebration. It's going to be a very busy week. Not really looking forward to it. Hope I can stay well.
Had a great time today at Schimpf's Candy and then Christmas at the Galt House.
You can tell a lot about a person by the friends they choose. My son picks some really good guys for friends. Proud of you Colin Hardin.

Not to be corny, but the disappointment of not getting the house is overshadowed by the joy the Christ child, Jesus; the Prince of Peace.
@fighting4jesus had to make a new offer on the house. Hoping they accept.
Praying for a positive response. Regardless, God is an awesome God who reigns from above, full of love and grace and I'll love him the same.
Just had the BEST visit to Schimpff's Candy. We got watch them make and them sample warm fresh red hot drops. YUM!
Praying for efficiency in the loan processing so that we can actually close on the house Thursday. I want a house for Christmas. :)
I had a great time tonight with my Ott family. I am truly blessed to have been born into such a loving, warm & fun family. God is good.
It is‚Ä¶SNOWING!!!!! :) Yea!
I am open this week for any plumbing work if you have a need. Just contact me and let me know what you need done.
I continue to be amazed and bewildered by God. I don't know why he does what he does sometimes. I just have to follow Him one day at a time.
Had a great day at #rivervalleychristian. Awesome morning of worship & teaching followed by a GREAT kids Christmas program this evening.
Happy 12th birthday to Colin! He is truly one of the most amazing kids I know. So full of talent, intelligence and life. I'm a proud dad.
Wow! Decorating the Christmas tree is a lot louder than than it was when I was a kid. Being an only child is not easy when you have 3 kids.
I'm beginning to think Black Friday has overshadowed Thanksgiving. A day that has been devoted to thanks has become 'shopping eve'.
I would be amiss in my Thanksgiving countdown if I didn't mention Green Bay Football. Go Pack Go!
A little sad to turn off the #Macy'sParade. It no longer represents my family or what it values. Guess it's time to find a new tradition.
Day 24: Thankful for every good and perfect gift that comes from God; the comfortable & the uncomfortable the pleasant & the unpleasant.
Day 23: Thankful for days off and sone time to spend with my wonderful family.
Day 22: Thankful for ‚Ä¶ my iPhone. Yes I know it's a little shallow but I really like my iPhone.
Day 21: Thankful for a bed to sleep in, indoor plumbing, and the warm, dry conditions a house provides.
Day 20: Thankful for clean water. How often do I take THIS for granted?!
Day 19: Thankful for the comforts of life. But realize some of those things I call essentials in life, are extravagances for others.
10 years ago today I held my first little girl for the first time. Little did I know what an amazing gift she would be. Happy B-Day Kaylee!
For the best electronic device cases buy @OtterBox. Great product w/ a warranty that's backed up by excellent customer service. #reccomend
Day 20: Thankful for a best friend who either gets my jokes or at least - in love - patronizes me with a laugh. Thanks @mommamezzo / BFF :)
Day 19: Thankful for laughter. There is a lot of potential laughter in my family. I just need to remember to participate in it.
Not a pretty win but it's a win. Packers are 10-0. Let's hope they look a little better on Thanksgiving.
Day 18: Thankful for my job. Though frustrated I'm not doing what my heart desires, I do NOT overlook that God has provided for me.
Day 17: Thankful I can play guitar. I'm not great, but thanks Mom, Rick M and others for helping me get where I am. It is good for my soul.
Day 16: Thankful my Heavenly Father doesn't have the same limitations & shortcomings that I do as a father.
Day 15: Thankful for handy skills I've been taught over the years. Thanks to dad, pop & the many others for my plumbing & fixit abilities.
14-0 Whoo! I'm liking what I see! Go Pack Go!
Day 14: Thankful for a dad who showed me how to be a husband, father and responsible man of God.
Happy Birthday to my dad, one of the most servant hearted people I know. Thanks for the example you've lived.
Day 13: Thankful for music. It is so much of who I am. I always want to do more & be better but I'm thankful for the talents I have.
Day 12: I'm thankful for my parents. I'm blessed with parents who gave me an example of loving each other and putting each other first.
Day 11: Even when disappointed, I am thankful for this country & the freedoms we have because of the sacrifice of so many. Thank you all!
THD is playing patriotic music for veterans day. That's great but trying to work and lead with "Taps" playing overhead is NOT motivating!
Day 10: I'm thankful for my baby girl, my joy, my Abby. She is the funniest &  most thoughtful girl I've known. She is truly a wonder.
Penn St students riot over a game, team and coach. Meanwhile, 8 young men have to live with a heinous assault forever. Where are our values?
Day 9: I'm thankful for my first girl, my Kaylee. She is a kindred spirit. She amazes me with her servant's heart and spiritual sensitivity.
Day 8: I'm thankful for my first born, my son, my pally, Colin. No one makes me prouder. He amazes me with his intelligence and talent.
Day 7: I'm thankful for my best friend, my partner, my love, my support, my encourager, my joy, my heart, my wife, my Rebekah.
For those who said the Packers were going down today I say, "8-0 my friends, 8-0" Go Pack Go!
Day 6: I'm thankful for God's Word: the living, inspired, relevant, and inerrant Holy Scripture.
Day 5: I'm really thankful for God's awesome and beautiful creation.
Day 4: I'm thankful for God's forgiveness that lifts the weight of my sins.
Note: If you're old enough to drive, you're too old for trick-or-treating.
Have had a few people ask if I still do plumbing. Yes, I do plumbing on the side; weekday evenings and Saturdays. Just message me or email.
Oh yeah, 7-0! Take a week off boys, you earned it. Go! Pack! Go!
Renewed my vows to my bride today. She is 100% God's gift to me. I cherish her more than all that this world has to offer.
Had a great time tonight with a lot of friends. Feeling blessed!
God is definitely leading us down a hidden but exciting path. I'm so thankful for his faithfulness; even in the midst of my doubts.
I'm ready for a long overdue nap.
I should focus more on the precise orchestration and organization of the universe. God's timing and plans are perfect; even in this moment.
Fatherhood is not for the faint of heart but to do it well requires a humble heart. For men, courage often comes easier than humility.
I was reminded yesterday that my wife is an amazing representation of God's grace. I am SO thankful we get to share life and love.
Packers win, Patriots lose. It's a good day in football. Go! Pack! Go!
Had a great morning of worship and was challenged as a husband at RVCC, Plus, I spent some time with loving and supportive friends.
Dissappointed by Big Bang. One uncomfortable joke the whole hour. Find a new joke. More to laugh at than sex, especially when it's casual.
Excited about Big Bang Theory and The Office tonight.
Looking forward to having the family home together tonight.
I'm really hoping this day can make its way out of the sewer before it's over. :/
I see a GB Packers Super Bowl repeat in the near future. Go! Pack! Go!
Great night tonight, Cards kicked butt in Lexington and I finally saw Thor. All is well.
Can't believe Colin is going to a school dance tonight & apparently has a 'date'. PLEASE God let him be like his mother and not me.
Enjoyed an afternoon at the park fishing with the kids. Just wish my sweetheart could have been there.
Go! Pack! Go! After that first drive and score I think I'll sleep a little better. Goodnight, Go Pack!
