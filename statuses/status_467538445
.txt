About to watch a 7 million dollar budget movie that I bet is better than World War Z( ok I promise to stop venting about that pile of shit).
But why he made World War Z is besides me. It was so bad and the zombies were fucking boring as hell. Give me Shaun of the Dead anyday!
I also loved Meet Joe Black 90 million budget &amp; grossed over 142 million. Gotta admit Pitt is box office magic usually...
Personally I liked Brad Pitt in Legends of the Fall one of my all time favs which cost 30 million &amp; made 160 million. One of his best roles.
World War Z was such a piece of crap. It was Brad Pitt's highest grossing picture to date. It cost 190 million to make &amp; made 540 million.
I rated World War Z 4/10  #IMDb Bad w/ no plot &amp; not scary zombies. I can't believe Brad Pitt made this. http://t.co/nSuqcckeAh

Jordan Hill has such great energy and he plays strong unlike Pau.
I like Pau but he is beyond soft. Why can't he be more aggressive?
I am beyond pissed right now. The Lakers need 2 grow a pair. Why is it so hard for them to play defense? Fuck put a hand up or something.
WTF I looked away and now we are down 10 points
So happy Steve Nash is playing. #GoLakers 🏀
