It's plain #AlexAnthopolous has had no money from #Rogers since at least last #WinterMeetings at which he made no significant moves either.
#Rogers has money ... shameful not to spend it when it's important to do so; when the very rare opportunity to win it all presents itself.
#BlueJays need ownership that approach an #MLB team as a distinct business run irrespective of other corporate concerns.
Of course #BlueJays moves still possible ... but need to pass through waivers, which leaves them subject to will of other teams. #NoPlanHere
#BlueJays only #ALEast team not involved in a significant trade to improve OR cut bait. #NoPlanHere. It's pointless to aim for 85-93 wins.
Watch the #BlueJays now sink in the standings to where they aim for ... mediocrity.
So #BlueJays plan for the rest of the season at the #MLBTradeDeadline ... NOTHING.  Thanks for the effort #Rogers.

The #1 and #2 slots will have players with more walks than those in the #4 and #5 slots.
Your three best hitters should bat somewhere in the #1, #2, &amp; #4 slots.Your fourth- and fifth-best hitters should occupy the #3 &amp; #5 slots.
