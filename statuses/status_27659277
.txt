@AmazonVideoUK Why send me a link to report a problem with my Amazon shopping basket when I want to report problems with LoveFilm delivery?
@AmazonVideoUK Why suggest going to my rental list to report problems with disc delivery as you know perfectly well this functions disabled?
@AmazonVideoUK How do I report an overdue dispatch? You emailed to confirm receipt of my last disc 04.03.14
@AmazonVideoUK How soon is asap?
@AmazonVideoUK yes still a problem; issue isn't finding the page, despite new UX, it's that the 60+ titles I'd prioritised are now missing!
@LOVEFiLMByPost @AmazonVideoUK Need your help - where's my LoveFilm rental list gone? Entire listing has disappeared?
It would appear I no longer #LoveFilm :-( #amazon #problems
