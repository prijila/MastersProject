The idea of wanting Arsenal to win the league is just wrong but looking at the other realistic options it's the only choice :(

@scowy1975 I'm thinking more of his early career when he used to score regularly.  Both players overall stats must be very similar.

1st FF transfer night in years where nobody has asked - 'is the 5 million already included'?

@DavidRoyal527 ok cheers for letting me know.  See you at the UEA.
Discovered tonight that someone I work with likes Fad Gadget.  Bloody brilliant.
@elliewardrope Cheers. 
Saturday looks really good but in the absence of the Smiths playing, a holiday with Mr And Mrs W is still good :)
@elliewardrope who's playing?
@TimStephenson no worries, always nice to see recognition for good companies and ideas.
@1stCynicalBitch @bpharoah @adebarbs 
Patience people, please.  I'm not a Belieber btw.
@bpharoah I've got something to 'trump' both of them on Thursday.... watch this space.
@1stCynicalBitch give it a listen, I've played it twice and it's a definite return to form.

Fair play to him though for being outspoken as always.

@wardrope4 He looks completely lost, it's almost as if he's forgotten how to play football.  It's a concern as he was great last season.
Good point.  Spurs definitely deserved something.  Match changed when Cleverley and Kagawa went off.  United get all the decisions ;)
#mufc
@timseesthelight No, although Andy Townsend is a very close 2nd.
@ManningTown stating the obvious I know but you need to be safe before the last game of the season.
@timseesthelight @manningtown Which side full-back are you unhappy with?
RT @markarmy: No #ncfc players put up for interview post Liverpool match.#pinkun
@timseesthelight @manningtown Any obvious answers or solutions?
@ManningTown You might well be right, it's going to be very tight with probably 9 teams involved.  Could do with a WBA win in the late game.
There's a lot of teams I would like to get relegated this season but Villa, QPR and the wee club in the North East would be a special three.
@woodbeast69 yeah it's been really poor, desperately need some new blood this month.
Cheers Norwich for deciding not to turn up against Liverpool and Manchester City again this season :(

@ManningTown we don't need him, unless he can play centre midfield!
@woodbeast69 it was ok, a fairly easy 3 points with a more than welcome clean sheet.  Kagawa when he's fully fit will be the real deal.
@kkez18 yeah I think your right, I thought he was good last season but at the moment he looks like 'a cat caught in the headlights'
@paulrothon_sky haha absolutely.
Kagawa was excellent in the 1st half, Vidic and Evans solid all game.  Valencia very poor. WBA good 2nd half.  Welcome clean sheet.

@wardrope4 yeah you could be right.  The last two games this afternoon are massive.

Personally I would have had a tribute too John Bond on the programme cover tomorrow. #ncfc http://t.co/GUuvjtx1
@twitter please help, I cannot upload photos from my phone using the iPhone app.
@elliewardrope c'mon think positive you can do it :)
@GNev2 Morning Gary, what's the song for today?  The Courteeners 'Not Nineteen Forever' would be good, as I head for the gym!
I love cycling on the road but hate riding on an exercise bike.
I can't stand running outside but strangely enjoy the treadmill.
#weird
@kkez18 I certainly do, just bought tickets and downloaded the ep.
#peace
Peace at the @NorwichArtCentr in December sounds good.
#peace
There's something about Alan Pardew I really don't like.  He's a good manager but very annoying.
@ManningTown @timseesthelight the lack of goals could very soon become a big worry.  Who would you play up top against the scousers?
@timseesthelight @manningtown fat boy is going to have to find his goal scoring boots quickly then.
@ManningTown what is?
RT @Jay_in_Essex: That goal was brought to you by Ginsters and Hagen Dazs.
‚Äú@wardrope4: All teams to score in tonights league cup games could land me a fortune.‚Äù

Norwich ??!?!!??!
@ManningTown yeah sounds ideal, cheers for doing that, is the cash on the night ok?
@ManningTown can you get ours for us then?
@ManningTown yeah that would be good, have you got your tickets already?
@ManningTown I'm probably going to get tickets for me and Oliver.
@ManningTown oh right, lets hope you get something else sorted soon.  First pint in the Plough is on me when you get here.

@ManningTown when are you moving to the 'fine city', looking forward to a couple of beers when you do.
RT @Mkmatty83: John Terry's a racist, He wear's a Nazi's hat, His dad will sell you charlie, His mum will rob your flat  #altogethernow
RT @wardrope4: At least 4 years too late #terry
@racheyroo1991 Jesus, that's a hell of a sneeze.
@timseesthelight your a big fan of Gerry and the Pacemakers then?
@StanCollymore what's your point?
‚Äú@jordywardy717: 3 points and move on! Wasn't pretty but we got there.‚Äù

That's all that fixture is about.  Spot on. #mufc
@AdeBarbs haha, how could I forget.  Drinkell and Biggins weren't bad either.
Considering they didn't get on very well Sheringham and Cole were a bloody good partnership. #mufc
Time for the next season preview. 00/01 MUFC. The season Citeh got relegated. #mufc
@paulrothon_sky @wardrope4 @jordywardy717 @kkez18 I'm lost for words really.  Candles and x-factor!!
@DuncanMacdonald it's a real grower of an album, better with every play. #alt-j
@wardrope4 please don't tell me they are all watching X factor...
Saturday night tv is so shit.
Family tree searching is so stressful but also really rewarding when you eventually track down what your looking for. #lovatt #WWII

@paulrothon_sky yeah absolutely, he scored a couple of crackers from outside the box in Europe as well. #keano #mufc
I meant 99/00 season. #mufc
Watched MUFC 09/00 season review last night.  I had forgotten how excellent Cole and Keane were that season.  #mufc

TFI Friday.

@kkez18 that's nice, manners don't cost a thing.
Agreed about last night, the atmosphere sounded shit as well, apart from the Turks.

When is it on?
I used to be able to view photos on Twitter using the official app on my phone, now I can't with the latest version of Twitter, any ideas?
RT @homelessbebe: Get him on the flight he can kip at Bebe's tonight. #VivaRonaldo
Keano is brilliant, surely the only reason anyone would watch ITV football coverage. #jogonchiles
Brilliant 2nd half.  Viva Ronaldo.  Love the Champions League.
Ronaldo.  Yes get in. #CR7
‚Äú@Will_Lumb: City will nick this, mark my words‚Äù

Yep you were right, still 20 to go though, c'mon Ronaldo...
‚Äú@DuncanMacdonald: @Wardrope_S the tooth didn't make it!‚Äù

I didn't think it would, Ladbrokes wouldn't quote a price it was that certain!!

@DuncanMacdonald that's top drawer, I'd forgotten about Lexi or Japanese Mercedes.
@DuncanMacdonald Did you not go for a Flavia frothy cappuccino like Alan Partridge?? #servicestation #roadtrip
@wardrope4 yeah, although its alt-j in front at the moment as I can't stop playing it.
Alt-J 'An Awesome Wave' is easily the best new album I have heard this year.  Wonderful stuff.
#alt-j
@wardrope4 is the Alt-J album any good?  They were pretty good supporting Wild Beasts in March &amp; I wondered if the album is worth a listen.
‚Äú@bpharoah: @Wardrope_S Yes! Welcome to my world!‚Äù

Is grunting optional or compulsory?
Midlife crisis well and truly kicked in.  I've joined a gym.
Wilkinson the Stoke full back is just a thug, awful footballer. #ihatestoke
Typical Stoke goal, three yards out. #ihatestoke
Berbatov.  Class is permanent.
‚Äú@kkez18: Paul Scholes.‚Äù
Treasure every moment, still the best midfielder in the league.  Class.
Analysis and opinion from Alan Shearer!!!!!  I doubt it. #imnowofftocreasotemyfence
The Jam 'Sound Affects' playing very loudly in the Wardrope household, the boss must be out ;) #thejam
RT @KaiWayne: So, after just 4 games the "Big 5" (Chelsea, United, Arsenal, City and Liverpool) are in positions - 1, 2, 3, 4 and.......17.
@bpharoah thanks for the #.  #thatsmyboy
@ManningTown @wardrope4 that's hilarious.  I can't believe the mobile was switched on!!
Easy money.  Another few quid won on a 4-0 score line against Wigan.
Afternoon spent watching Spixworth vs Wroxham with Jnr W. Pint after the game and Ollie then asks 'can we get a curry on the way home' :)
RT @BeardedGenius: One of Scholes or Giggs in the team makes me happy, two worries me. Like two lads bent over for a game of leapfrog.
@jordywardy717 how many years has it taken you to work that out!!!!
@paulrothon_sky @wardrope4 @jordywardy717 I've got both of those as home wins. #justsaying
‚Äú@wardrope4: A47/A17 route to #Nottingham this morning was shit.‚Äù

No surprise there, both those roads are always shit.
‚Äú@ManningTown: #gameday #clubovercountry #youknowtherulesdonotbetontheearlykickoff‚Äù

Oh shit, Norwich are part of my accumulator.
12 hours sleep.  Bloody brilliant. :)
RT @PigeonJon: There is no fucking way a Cow can jump over the Moon. I have seen Cows.
@BeardedGenius it's good to have you back.  Wise words.
@BakeOffWebsite @groom_lia @duncanmacdonald I can personally vouch for that as I was lucky enough to have one &amp; they were lovely.
@StephenMangan excellent news, absolutely love that show. #episodes
Finally got round to watching 'Senna' film/documentary.  Bloody brilliant viewing, I had forgotten how good F1 used to be. #senna
@PeteBoyle70 'Swimming Pools Movie Stars' by the brilliant Wedding Present.
@_PaulHayward I think it's an issue that affects more than just two clubs.  
I like the use of a great New Order album title btw.
One look at the Mercury Music Prize list tells you that it has been a pretty shit year for music. #MercuryPrize
I've retired from international football.  Complete waste of time.  Pies and cycling all the way tonight.
Lost your love of life? Too much apple pie... #Kennedy #weddingpresent  

Thanks to the Great British Bake Off talking about apple pies
It's pie week.  Everyone loves a nice pie. #greatbritishbakeoff
@PeteBoyle70 Even as a United fan I always secretly loved the WBA kits in the 70s and 80s.
Great British Bake Off time.  Excellent. #bbc2 #round5
‚Äú@elliewardrope: my pooch keeps losing her hair because of stress üòûüê∂‚Äù
Milly had stress a year ago, it must be a Wardrope pet problem!!
@wardrope4 Does Djokovic remind you of Fad Gadget a bit, or is it just me?
Toilet break.  Come on Murray. #USOpenFinal #Murray
@wardrope4 @kkez18 it's a bloody good setlist but New Order without Hooky is just not right.
@ManningTown you jammy git.  I'm looking for 6-0, 6-0 in the next two sets!!!
Thank god for that, now I can go to the loo!!! #murray #USOpenFinal
@jordywardy717 the weather is going to play a huge part in this final.  Whoever copes the best with that will win. #USOpen
@ScottHayes3 the weather is going to play a huge part in this match. #USOpen #windy
It's Murray's time, please let it be true. #USOpen
Hats off to Coldplay.  Great ending to the games. #closingceremony

Murray held his nerve really well in the fourth set.  One more game to go.  Go on Andy. #USOpen
Exercise done for the day, great bike riding weather, next stop footy training for the under 7's.
So, England will qualify from an easy group again and then be utterly shit in the final tournament.  Why bother?
@_PaulHayward Murray US Open?????
@wardrope4 don't blame you, make the most of the good weather.
@wardrope4 in Norwich???
‚Äú@timseesthelight: @Wardrope_S they're actually playing quite well mate!‚Äù
I'll stick with the film.
I'd rather stick rusty nails in my eyes than watch another England game on ITV.  It's Love Film time.
RT @BFTGT: Gerrard and Lampard first played together for England on February 13th 2002... Over ten years later we're still flogging that ...
RT @DesKellyDM: The Paralympics is simply brilliant! David Weir... wonderful gold. What a race. What a man. @c4paralympics
@wardrope4 what were the 4 albums you downloaded the other day?  I desperately need something good and new to listen too.
‚Äú@wardrope4: First time having a drink at @elliewardrope new work #iconic‚Äù
What do you think?
@paulrothon_sky I think I might do the same, is the William Hill one definitely better?
Yet again I'm having problems logging into my @ladbrokes account using their iPad app.  Sort it out Ladbrokes.
@wardrope4 are you planning on watching the Tour Of Britain anywhere on Sunday?
@ManningTown no thanks cheers for the offer though.
@wardrope4 that sounds familiar as Mrs W hated it as well.  I think it's one of the best films I've seen in the last five years. #drive
Just watched Ides Of March another good Ryan Gosling film.  Not quite as good as Drive though, which is awesome. #ryangosling
‚Äú@elliewardrope: just registered for glasto 2013 oot oot‚Äù

Now that's a good festival, good luck.
@AdeBarbs nice touch Mr Barber.
Yet again I have fallen asleep watching a Sherlock Holmes film.
Cracking result in the end today but two areas of concern
1.  Both full backs aren't good enough defensively
2.  Welbeck is wasted out wide.
‚Äú@danesayer: Don't underestimate the impact Paul Scholes can have on a game of football.‚Äù
100% agreed, he's still got it.
‚Äú@timseesthelight: @Wardrope_S #timknowsfootball‚Äù
Great prediction, I honestly couldn't see it today, especially after the pen.
RT @DanielHarris: Imagine taking a penalty of that ilk, and returning to a dressing room that had Roy Keane in it.
‚Äú@timseesthelight: It's not often that I cheer United on, but I really want them to win.‚Äù
Not a chance today, they have been awful.
Shit penalty, put your bloody foot through it.
Can Rafael please go and join his brother at QPR.  Nobody is ever going to convince me that he is a defender. #headless
@ManningTown I'm really pleased for you :). Stupid game.
C'mon Murray, finish this game off.  I can't afford to lose anymore money betting on you to win a grand slam. #usopen
This captain malarkey in #dreamteam is doing my head in.  #throwingmytoysoutofthepram
@wardrope4 @jordywardy717 cheers, I've never played, will ask Dad to show Oliver.
@PeteBoyle70 agree with two of those but Stoke instead of Sunderland would be nice.
@woodbeast69 I would laugh if it wasn't so tragic
@jordywardy717 he watched some old guys play it today and said I want to learn.  Your the only person I could think of who knows the game :)
@jordywardy717 Oliver wants to know if you can teach him to play cribbage?
@kkez18 when do you think you will get to your 1st United game this season?  I'm looking at Arsenal at OT.
QPR to get relegated, please and thank you.  Awful club.
@ManningTown you know that Norwich have a place in my heart.
@ManningTown agreed but you can tell her :)
@originalmajato have you got a nose bleed? #WBA
Norwich were robbed.  Halsey missed a blatant pen. #NCFC
Why have Spurs bought a new keeper when they have got Friedel?
The only thing I like about Spurs is the fact that my Mum supports them.  Nothing else, zero.
@woodbeast69 it's a good time to play Spurs away as they look a bit rusty and urgently need their new signings.
Ive just got some #dreamteam points, woop woop.  #fletcher
@woodbeast69 it's no stop here mate.  Norwich look comfortable at the moment, a draw would be a good result.
@woodbeast69 watching the Norwich game in the Longe Arms with Italian commentary.  C'mon you yellows.
My week off drink lasted 4 days, I'm off to the boozer to watch the Norwich game.  I'm blaming it all on flat-pack furniture.
