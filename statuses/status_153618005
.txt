#TheVoiceWildCard isn't fair. They've had time to rest their voices and are up against people who haven't. #nbcthevoice #thevoice
That ending is exactly what makes #Revenge so addictive. They're not afraid to kill off main characters and shock the hell out of you.

There is no way I wouldn't know my own kid. #revenge
I loved the original coaches on #thevoice &amp; can't believe how quickly @gwenstefani &amp; @Pharrell have won me over. Best coaching season yet.
How many different ways can you say "it's so hard to choose"? Just choose. #thevoice
@alovelygrl but why would he have turned on Nolan? He just ruined any chance of Nolan having a career comeback. :(
@2PACisalive_ yeah but they don't say what she actually said. They love to make it look a certain way and then it's not what you'd hoped.
@thejordache exactly.
@callme_leen no he's going to introduce himself as her neighbor and she won't tell him. Like a parent wouldn't recognize his own kid.
@freddy25 she's still not going to tell him, it's a tease. So aggravating.
So annoyed with #Revenge writers right now. More questions and no answers.
Something good better happen soon on #Revenge. It's been so frustrating this season. C'mon writers, give us something.

@raindiamonds @beautysweetspot @ponds Love coconut oil for my hair. It seriously works wonders for softness and shine! #PONDSBB
@BeautySweetSpot @PONDS Thank you for taking the time to be here today! #PONDSBB
@BeautySweetSpot @PONDS Thoughts on using coconut or EVOO on skin? It's so trendy right now. Also coconut water, what do you think? #PONDSBB
@BeautySweetSpot @PONDS I stay glowing with 2 things. Moisturizing twice  day and drinking a ton of water! #PONDSBB
@BeautySweetSpot @PONDS I run!
@PONDS how do you manage to stay healthy when you're working such long hours? #PONDSBB
@amandakreece @PONDS Yes, the coverage is sheer but still effective!
@lindseymcg @BeautySweetSpot @PONDS This is a great question.
RT @Yiononta: Keep Skincare Simple @ponds, @beautysweetspot #PONDSBB
@BeautySweetSpot @PONDS at what age do you recommend we start using anti-aging products. Specifically Retinol? #PONDSBB
@PONDS do you use a lot of anti-aging skin care products? And if so, when did you start? #PONDSBB
My favorite thing about #PONDSBB is the finish. It doesn't make my combo skin look greasy like other bb creams.
@PONDS These questions are fantastic! #PONDSBB
@PONDS Does #PONDSBB help to fade dark spots and acne scarring?
@christielomb @BeautySweetSpot @PONDS YES!!
@LovenFlipflops @BeautySweetSpot @PONDS I want to know this one too!
@PONDS So what happens with Rayna and Deacon?? Just kidding, couldn't resist. I always say you are the most beautiful one on the show!
@mfashforward @ponds I love the texture too, it's more "substantial" than other bb creams so it evens skin tone really well.
@jennaannmorr I totally agree! Great advice!
RT @ChiDivaOnADime: @raindiamonds Yes mom even started me with @PONDS when I was young. Cold cream to be exact.#PONDSBB
@PONDS BB Cream's coverage is impressive. Tested it against drugstore and high end bb creams and it blows my mind how good it is! #PONDSBB
@PONDS That is the biggest thing I stress to readers. Best tip my mom ever gave me.
RT @PONDS: Honestly, the most important thing to me is keeping my skin moisturized. #PONDSBB
@Ponds @Influenster Looking forward to the #PondsBB twitter party. I wanna know Connie Britton's secrets; whatever she is doing, I'm sold.
