So since Sunday I've been feeling a small lump in my throat when I swallow and I feel like its growing  and today it's more painful :/
RT @YayJesusMinist: Enjoy. God. Forever.
@hurleygirl93 without it I would definitely not be as encouraged and I wouldn't know what I should eat!but with the app I record my meals :)
@hurleygirl93 I know!I will definitely eat a lot more before exercising lol and maybe take more breaks..i LOVE my calorie counter app ^_^
@hurleygirl93 food before I had exercised :/ I would've maybe passed out then Dx
@hurleygirl93 ya I was scared and nauseated yet so hungry lol but imagine if I jogged outside instead Dx so hot!and what if I hadn't ate
@hurleygirl93 so I ended up eating a salad and then took a nap feeling a little sick and then woke up happy :) lol
@hurleygirl93 a banana and cereal and nicely a lot better and then an hour later I felt sick again :/ guess the food still wasn't enough lol
@hurleygirl93 aww haha I never got that dizzy for some reason yet today was scary :O I could barely walk and my hands shook a lot so I ate
@hurleygirl93 haha I know I would be sooo hungry and then my stomach  just was so used to it that my appetite was very small Dx
@hurleygirl93 days last week 'cause I wasn't paying attention to my portions :/ lol I'm good now though!
@hurleygirl93 I'm supposed to lose 2lbs. A week with my diet but ive only lost 1lb. So far a week but it's 'cause I went over my cals. For 2
@hurleygirl93 aww &lt;3 that song haha
@hurleygirl93 about 10lbs. Since November and it's cuz I only ate like once a day O.o
@hurleygirl93 :O oh gosh really? Dang it's prolly 'cause you don't eat much right? I was the same way awhile after I got married I've lost
@hurleygirl93 ya it's so weird I was never used to eating many small meals instead of 3 large ones but it's not so bad :)
@hurleygirl93 haha I know it's working 'cause I lose a pound a week!supposedly by August 31st I will reach my goal to lose 20 pounds ^_^

@hurleygirl93 2,000 calorie diet I'm down to 1,200 calories per day
@hurleygirl93 haha I know!I eat a lot less than usual now so I guess it's all so much of a change for my body 'cause Instead of my average
@hurleygirl93 before I started REALLY working out
@hurleygirl93 out from all the calories I lost lol I thought an hour would be good on the treadmill but I used to always stick with 15 min.
@hurleygirl93 I actually drank 2 water bottles before!I think 'cause I exercised so early and my breakfast before was pretty munched wiped
@hurleygirl93 alright it's on &gt;:D!!haha!!xD jk omg crazzzzayyy!!!
