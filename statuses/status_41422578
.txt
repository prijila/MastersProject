@punt_hunt @kevinbridges86 The man was old to me so this is how I described him. No need for the 'prick' comment.
@punt_hunt @kevinbridges86 just being descriptive. Why so aggressive......
@milesSI @OllieDS Message received loud and clear. It's a shame tho, here's hoping the enhancement makes it worthwhile.
@milesSI @OllieDS Upgrade the kit icon then but don't make it a square block. It may seem a small change to some but hope you listen to fans
@milesSI @OllieDS I'm with you Oliver, no offence but they look horrible. Why get rid of the kits, it's iconic of the game. #keepthekits
@milesSI @FootballManager Don't look as good though. So no chance of the kits coming back then........ #fingerscrossed

@kasabian77 @SouthamptonFC I was gonna buy one after the match but they look really bad. How can there be such a difference between 2 sizes?
@MissterRichard @talkSAINTS I agree, Pellé was very 'string' on the ball!! 😂 #gottalovepredictivetext

@SouthamptonFC Please can you explain changes made to the shirt sizing for this years kit? XL is like L last year and XXL is like a dress!
@talkSAINTS Positives - Täider, Pellé &amp; Davis. Negatives - Isgrove, Maya and lack of goal scoring chances.

@mrjakehumphrey completely disagree, he's not top class &amp; doesnt deserve 2 b picked by England. If he played for any other team he wouldn't
@ManUtd I don't care if he just scored, he's still not world class. #neveraninternational #lucky #RightPlaceRightTime
Danny Welbeck is by far the worst player ever to pull on an England shirt. Just because you play for @ManUtd doesn't make you a top player.
