It's been quite some time since I've watched a horror through my fingers so kudos Honeymoon, you left me trembling!!!
Enjoyed watching some knacker get the brush off. His best lines were greeted by headphones and a look of pity!!!
I constantly seem to find myself in shops I don't want to be in, waiting until it's safe to pass the clipboards and surveyors!!!
Time to avoid social media until I've finished watching @TheWalkingDead!!!
@missnufc Thank you!!!
Celebrating our second anniversary tonight even though @Patriots are on @SkySportsNFL. A modern day definition of love!!!
@new_matthew I just can't believe you're tweeting. I value your movie reviews so will avoid Regression!!!
@new_matthew Think you've been hacked!!!
@kaneorobinson Yeah mate, didn't see this last night. Just a few in and around town. Out yourself?
Awesome buzz about Newcastle this eve. Welcome Scotland and the rest of the world, I hope you've left some drink for me!!!
@FordService_UK Can you call me please?
@Peaza01 @johnliddell1982 Could another trip be on the cards? http://t.co/6cVBIAn1h8
It may have been a mistake to stay up and listen @RSprachrohr. Seriously pumped up now!!!
@UPEDScompany Ha hope this reply doesn't wake you then!!!
@BTCare I wouldn't have known if I hadn't called to ask. Running behind due to workload. Would have been nice to hear from you though!!!
When waiting for a delivery etc; does anyone ever get seen before the very last 10 minutes? #asleepintheirvans
Disgraceful service by @BTCare and @Openreach_news. Waited for a technician between 1pm and 6pm and yet no one showed up!!! #wasteofhalfaday
@SkyHelpTeam 3.2.1... No technician!!!
@SkyHelpTeam Can you please confirm a technician will be coming to my house between 1-6?
Thank you @Patriots and in advance @PapaJohnsUK. #50for50
As much as I'm disappointed we lost a two goal lead, you can't fault that performance!!! #NUFC
Mitrovic loves a good celebration. I've a feeling @AyozePG will leave this game suffering from whiplash!!! #NUFC
Awesome souvenirs from New England. My boy is gunna be part of the @Patriots!!! #numberonefan http://t.co/VyoRQfIcSK
Well, @NUFC are a disgrace. No fight, no desire. Congrats @swfc you deserve to go through!!!
So that's me and the wife moving out of the house for a while. Seeing a rat/mouse will do that to you!!!
@SkyHelpTeam Broadband has still not been sorted, even after openreach technician came last week!!! http://t.co/ZaCNDMemTA
@C2CRestaurants Arlington, Texas!!!
@missnufc @NUFC Just shows how desperate I'm becoming!!!
@missnufc @NUFC You can't seriously think he has been playing well since he flash in the pan half season?
It may take a few years but I volunteer to pay whatever it takes for Cisse to leave @NUFC. Even if it means taking out a Wonga loan!!!
I don't think I'll ever understand Cisse, absolute dross once again!!!
CISSE MAN. TAKE A TOUCH!!!
One minute injury time after an injury and substitution?
There's bound to be logistical problems with @My_Metro. It's not like it's the 35th Great North Run!!!
Please @CAFCofficial. One more goal!!!
Standard. Didn't even make it to opening both eyes this morning before seeing the @Patriots score. Damn @BR_NFL notifications!!!
Even though I've no chance, here hoping I can avoid the @Patriots score until tomorrow night!!!
Normally I would find myself excited that Notts are 46-5; but then I remember our performances with the bat since July!!!
@kaneorobinson You must also consider not recovering from previous. Rushed back too soon?
@kaneorobinson Love the hate and a snakes lack of hamstrings!!!
@JohnLaurinaitis @WWE @WWEUniverse YES. Make this happen!!!
Using your laptop to look for a new laptop seems rather disrespectful!!!
Enjoyed an evening with @PierceBrosnan on the big screen!!! #stillgotit
It seems @GillianA keeps getting better with age!!! #possiblexfile
@More2History Will you be showing the last few episodes of X-Files series one? Also are you showing the remaining eight series?
I wanted to be sick after watching Craig Gardner's little bitta play acting!!!
A hatrick against Club Brugge. That must mean Rooney is cured!!!
@kaneorobinson Almost as predictable as Arsenal finishing fourth!!!
The reaction of some on here (re: One Direction) is nothing short of pathetic. Give your heads a wobble!!! #OneDirection
Nothing makes me happier than watching Sterling fail at Man City. I'm not even a Liverpool fan!!!
Different season, same old luck. This time it's Wycombe Wanderers who have let me down for £326.23!!!
Great point for #NUFC after such resolute defending. Enough opportunities to be hopeful that the goals will come!!!
Time for Rooney to be released in to the fantasy football wilderness. Useless!!!
Has there ever been a more fantastic picture of @thexfiles Fox Mulder? If you tell me yes then you're lying!!! http://t.co/u4SRTn4JnQ
Red card aside, rather pleased with the first half. Fell behind after a defence splitting pass and a well taken goal!! #NUFC
The only people missing out are us @Marvel fans. Dreaming of stories that are not possible due to contracts held by different studios!!!
The solution is simple, return all rights back to @Marvel studios. @20thcenturyfox should welcome any revenue, covering financial loss!!!
It's a series that's very much work in progress but poor viewing figures and profits will bring about its premature end!!!
The amount of movies coming out of Marvel studios using the same formula has forced other studios to try something different!!!
It may not have been the best but the crippling reviews of Fantastic 4 and its IMDb rating of 3.9/10 are unjust!!! #marvel
Even though Lambert could potentially tear us apart in the air, this West Brom team are extremely poor!!! #MNF
I still can't play Street Fighter II thanks to @mattletiss7 and his goal against #NUFC at The Dell. Almost 22 years man!!!
@Nimble_Mango Haven't lost an Ashes match since my first series in 2005. Home pitch for Broad as well!!!
Reporting a house alarm to the police. Am I a good neighbour or just plain ridiculous? #safethansorry
Thank you @More2History for bringing @thexfiles back into my life. Here's hoping for all seasons and no nightmares!!! #nightlight
Well Arkham Knight was epic. What made it even better was discovering that @thejohnnoble voiced Scarecrow!!!
It won't be long before its Yorkshire vs. Australia in the Ashes!!!

@FrazerHallam Those people deserve to be unfollowed!!!
The news that @MCFC have agreed to pay £49 million for a jumped up @sterling31 has left me disillusioned with the state of football!!!
Please @Jon_Favreau direct a #friends spin off movie about Pete Becker and his journey to become the new @ufc champion!!!
I am at my wits end with Bairstow and Bresnan like. Did we not analyse their batting after their 300 run partnership against us?
@Nimble_Mango I'll be a pundit on sky sports next!!!
Right decision to bat with the lack of full time bowling options. Get a score and the pressure falls off!!! #TheAshes
@Whoispol @NetflixUK We need this before the new series is to begin!!!
@Nimble_Mango Bell will fall victim to Starc many time. Coupled with his test form, the ghosts of Ashes past will plague him!!!
Are all 201 episodes of the #XFiles available on @NetflixUK?
Anyone with a #XBOX let me know your #gamertag!!!
We need to be flexible with the batting order. The top four are snail pace. If we are on top, an aggressive batsman is needed!!! #Ashes2015
We need to be aggressive against Australia. It's what won us the Ashes in 2005. That in mind, Rashid in for Ali and Root to bat at four!!!
I thought my @NintendoUK Wii U would provide enough stimulation. I need more. I've been unfaithful. I've bought a #XboxOne!!! #gamerslut

@kaylzj88 My BB ain't going away so you can indulge next time. Yeah had a good time, glad to hear you did!!!
@kaylzj88 Thank you. Shame I seen so little of you all last night (I'm sure you're ok with that though!!!)
@Bri_Marsha it wasn't a party!!!
Looking forward to trying some of these tips from @Natures_Voice. Time to do my bit for nature!!! http://t.co/q64Wle788t
@carternufc How am I not playing in the NBA!!!
@DurhamCricket Perfect batting conditions but a bit of green to excite the bowlers. Knock of the remaining runs and take it from there!!!
That @Yorkshireccc XI is ridiculously good. Going to take a unbelievable performance from our boys to beat them!!! #DURvYOR

@MyNintendoNews If this didn't have Metroid in the title no one would buy it!!!
I've been left deflated by the @NintendoUK @e3 Digital Event. No details of the new console, no footage of Zelda for the Wii U!!! #sigh
It's all about Tears of War 4 and the ultimate edition!!! #E32015
It's the same every year. @E3 conference begins and so does the viewing of @RealChadWarden_ videos!!!
I do love a good batting point. Especially when they are a rare commodity this season!!!
@johnliddell1982 Couldn't make it up. I thought the press embargo had been lifted!!!
Never got to see the press conference. Did #McClaren try his hand at a Geordie accent? #NUFC
@YCabayeofficiel I can pick you up from Paris in my Ford Fiesta and bring you back to @NUFC. Imagine working under McClaren!!!
All hail the @WWENetwork. Finally get to watch @DavidOtunga on the WWE Raw Pre Show!!! http://t.co/rkPmrnIdcx
@carternufc I was in Sports Direct and the tops are going for £60 plus. I would love it, as much as keegan!!!
Maybe @DurhamCricket should try starting XI bowlers against Sussex. They have been outstanding with bat and ball!!!
@NintendoUK Is there an album you can purchase? I missed out on London!!!
A unexpected win on the work bonus ball. The perfect way to get over those Monday blues!!! #winner

In an empty auditorium, the cashier has me sat in between two couples!!! #extremegooseberry http://t.co/JfZnfXuYjc
Under Brendon McCullum, New Zealand are transforming Test Cricket. To score 454 at 5 an over is remarkable!!! #ENGvNZ
@JonFleming86 Now that is good timing. All I need now is an XboxOne!!!
I echo my previous thoughts. An outstanding game. I rated Tomb Raider (2013) 9/10  #IMDb http://t.co/M8vascgNxH
@SkyHelpTeam Is there an issue with your broadband service in the NE10 area?
@NUFC @elgalgojonas was one of a few players who performed during the latter part of the season. Your decision is shameful!!!
Does anyone know what happened to @ufc hopeful Pete Becker (@Jon_Favreau)? He was destined for great things!!!
I don't know how they did it but @DurhamCricket have pulled of a miracle to first save this game and then win it!!!
@kaneorobinson @pnefc @jpbeckford10 Boils my piss. I hope the scum receives only Monopoly money and chocolate coins!!!
If the woman actually stole the @pnefc @jpbeckford10 shirt from a child, she deserves the ten plagues of Egypt!!!
What a day. @NUFC survive, @benstokes38 gets a century, @WadeBarrett and @pnefc are in the @SkyBetChamp and @DurhamCricket are going well!!!
Even though it will never happen, if we can tempt @MrAncelotti out of sabbatical, he can take @NUFC into the top ten!!!
There's one player I can't stand and that's @Fellaini. A calculating thug of a player that deserves everything he gets!!! #scum
The new kit won me over. I almost consider buying it until it meant going to sports direct and wearing @WongaGillian!!!
@johnliddell1982 Happy tears. He knew he could leave the place forever!!!
Kudos to @Vurnon. One of his best games for @NUFC. The fact you didn't notice him in the first half means he did his job very well!!!
Is this the time we say 'mind the gap' to the @SunderlandAFC fans?
I am DELIGHTED for @elgalgojonas. Deserved MOTM, deserved his goal and deserves a contract extension. The guy is a survivor and a pro!!!
Tomb Raider is an outstanding game. She may not have pixel tits but Lara Croft still knows how to fight!!!
@canviseffects you may need to explain that one.
@canviseffects Not really, we have the best coach in the premier league after all!!!
Little bit of Tomb Raider to distract me from the build up of nerves. It may be in our own hands but it'll be Hull that do us a favour!!!
@DavidOtunga Come to England and help spot my 25kg bench press!!!
That is a performance to be proud of #SAFC fans. Sheer determination and guile to achieve survival once again!!!
@KP24 Shameful behaviour yet again by the @ECB_cricket. They never get it right do they?
As for @NUFC, this if true is tragic. Bland, lazy and unimaginative; a lot like their performances of late!!! http://t.co/pspuT3SoJ6
Most depressing shirt goes to Tranmere!!! #myeyes http://t.co/aklk36fqUU

Absolutely buzzin' for all the #NCLCUnited boys after winning a cup double this season!!!
All this talk of politics has me craving a bit of The Thick of It. Malcolm Tucker will know what to do!!!
@new_matthew Theres nothing worse than a smug Tory. The guy looked close to tears!!!
@_MartinDean ... they simply didn't want Conservatives and wanted to look after their own interests!!!
@_MartinDean I don't think he influenced Scotland. Based on the polls they knew there was a possibility of a Labour/SNP ...
Did Andrea Jenkyns just win an Oscar? #GE2015
Without voting reform, I can see @Conservatives being in power until the Earth is engulfed by the sun!!! #GE2015
@JoeH1985 When you say better does that mean once we've left the country or ate 30 pills?
@_MartinDean Thank you for screwing the rest of the UK over in pursuit of their own agenda. I hope they gain independence next time!!!
I actually feel sick that we have another 5 years of @Conservatives. Ironically there will be no NHS to treat my symptoms!!!
So the SNP conspiracy gathers momentum!!! #Election2015
I fully expect to wake up to fire and brimstone with David Cameron standing, trident in hand!!! #Election2015
So many feels for @EamonnHolmes having to spend the night in Sunderland. Hope he's had his inoculations!!! #Election2015
It's always fun hearing a pisshead be told they aren't registered to vote!!! #IVoted
BREAKING NEWS!!! 'I still think I can win a majority' #johncarverquotes
I hope everyone associated with @NUFC (including the tea lady) are watching @HullCity. This is the effort we supporters can only dream of!!!
Are they still on the pitch down at @BlackpoolFC?
The arse has fallen out of @NUFC!!!
The worst channel in the world is @ENews. They should be ashamed for existing!!!
For me @DurhamCricket MOTM has to go to @usman_arshad65 and @johnhastings194, purely for their partnership in the first innings!!!
@tomtoon2010 @nufcfans Continue with 4-4-2. Back to basics. Pointless having 5 in midfield when they're slow to support Perez!!!
@tomtoon2010 @nufcfans I agree, based on performance they've been exemplary. That being said, you can lead a horse to water ...
@tomtoon2010 @nufcfans We need someone, anyone to lead by example. Too many looking at the exit door regardless of what happens!!!
@tomtoon2010 @nufcfans The same could be said about Sunderland last season, Wigan, seasons before that. Teams that got results when needed!!
@tomtoon2010 @nufcfans Who would've thought Hull would beat Liverpool? If they can I'd expect more surprising result!!!
The fact that two of the teams below us have a game in hand is unnerving. Win and we are only two points off 18th with four games to go!!!
Ahhhh the pressures of dress down day at the office!!! #whattowear
@JimmyMullenYT download the update!!!
The new 200cc mode is an absolute blast. Who knew there was a button to brake on #MarioKart8!!!
Congratulations @krishgm on gaining the publicity you obviously crave. Your interview with @RobertDowneyJr was shameful and unnecessary!!!
@krishgm I got the impression that you seemed to be revelling in the situation you created. Poor taste in questioning!!!
There are no strings on me!!! #Ultron #AvengersAgeOfUltron
To make this day even better, the next #MarioKart8 goodies have been released. That's my evening sorted!!!
Last nights entertainment was outstanding. Another masterpiece from @josswhedon. Hulk vs. Hulkbuster was the pinnacle!! #AvengersAgeOfUltron

That episode of Hanger 1 was even more terrifying than normal. Suppose I have @mufon to thank!!!
No doubt Mike Ashley is enjoying all the extra advertising due to the world wide media coverage. #BoycottSpurs
Yes Gouffran lost possession but why was Chadli not closed down by any of our defensive midfield three!!! #NUFC
@benstokes38 Take away the wicket and it's just a no ball. Don't see people kicking off after every single one of them. Simply unlucky!
How selfish of @DurhamCricket to win within 3 days. What am I meant to listen to today!!!
Can someone tell @SkySports it is pronounced OberTAN not OberTON!!!
Not looking forward to the this evenings chores. Dishes, hoovering, watching #NUFC and the washing!!!
@Colly622 I hope you never retire!!!
Delighted to see @Trotty back in the @ECB_cricket starting XI. Here's hoping he scores big!!!
@GMMJohnson Well I doubt many more would want to watch re-runs of the World Cup matches for a gazillionth time!!!
@GMMJohnson You don't have to watch either. There is plenty out there who would enjoy it!!!
@JMK1043 @SkySports I know the @ECB_cricket game is on tomorrow but just show the first day of the defending champs. Should be tradition!!!
Anyway, today is a good day. The English summer has begun. Here's hoping for a successful season for @DurhamCricket!!!
It infuriates me that @SkySports do not show enough County Cricket. Sort it out. It's not all about TWENTY20 and international cricket!!!
Can you imagine @SkySports not showing the opening fixtures of the FOOTBALL season?
@JonFleming86 Well the exclusive titles are immense, specifically Bayonetta 2 and Wind Waker HD!!!
@JonFleming86 If you're prepared to never again play 3rd party games (no doubt you've a Xbox one for that though)
Another victory for the mighty Bayern Leverkusen. Shame Bullig didn't make it on to the scoresheet!!!
Sad to hear of the news that #RichieBenaud has passed away. Part of the #Ashes2005 commentary team that got me hooked on cricket!!!

The eight shards of Triforce was an absolute chore but #thewindwaker was a joy to play. Gorgeous, fun and yet challenging!!! #complete
I would love to see @KP24 as a future @ECB_cricket batting coach. Bringing both talent and knowledge from around the world of cricket!!!
As much as I want @KP24 to return to Test Cricket I don't think he can under Moores. Although the @ECB_cricket should sack the latter!!!
The mixed messages also go to show how much of a shambles communication is within @ECB_cricket!!!
Does anybody else think this whole @KP24 saga is a smokescreen by @ECB_cricket, deflecting attention and column inches from the failed WC!!!

Amusing and unsurprising news coming out of the @ECB_cricket this morning. A couple of 'injuries' announced just before a meaningless game!!
@kaneorobinson Jedi mind trick and it will be!!!
@kaneorobinson Find it please and I'll make an offer. The console collection continues!!!
@kaneorobinson get one and we can trade Pokemon 😄
@kaneorobinson Managed to get one on eBay for £18 and the game for £5. Lets hope they both work!!!
Looking forward to the Postman coming on Friday as he should have my original Gameboy and Super Mario Land en tow!!! #Nintendo #retrogaming
@colinmercer @KP24 How can they?
Managers need to make a stand against players cheating to gain an advantage. Do the right thing and out them. Then fine them!!!
Left disillusioned by the comments made by Paul Downton. Our 'inexperienced group of players' have 811 ODI caps between them #EnglandCricket
The only thing worse than @ECB_cricket performances are the press conferences following. Pre prepared statements to appease the masses!!!
@KP24 No doubt they will blame your tweets and opinions as a distraction to the team!!!
I hope there is now an serious inquisition in to this @ECB_cricket squad and its hierarchy after such an abhorrent World Cup!!! #EngvBan

@carternufc I reckon there's some sort of backhanded deals going on with bookies and teams in the lower divisions!!! #conspiracy
So, Norwich, a team at home who have won six games in a row are getting beat by Wigan. Makes sense!!!
Wonderful to see @elgalgojonas playing in black and white again!!!
@StuHFR Surprised he didn't leave out a leg and go down!!!
@MikeNE3 Did I read right; he shat on the floor?
Truly shocking news about Adam Johnson. Even if allegations turn out to be false, that's his reputation and quite possibly career over!!!
Think it's time to read @KP24 autobiography and find out what really goes on behind the scenes at @ECB_cricket!!!
For me @ECB need to cut out of form players, regardless of reputation. Omit them from the squad and make them hungry to return!! #complacent
Statistics now show that @ECB_cricket bowling attack have only taken 10 wickets in 5 of the last 19 ODI's!!! #England #CricketWorldCup
@FreakyTheory @NotExplained Based on what research or fact?

So I wake up to see England have won the #ICCWorldCup2015. Congratulations!!! #paperingoverthrcracks
@Original151 First two trainers were Brock and Misty, rock and water. No brainer!!!
@DurhamCricket When do they go on sale and how much are they?
What about the fact that some players are rotated within the batting/bowling order in order to accommodate big players? #EngvScot
Can't wait to buy my first ever TWENTY/20 season ticket at @DurhamCricket this season!!!
No changes? Perfect opportunity for Hales/Bopara to get some time in the middle against a medium pace attack. Drop Ballance!!! #EngvScot
The only reason I'm even considering watching #TheOscars2015 is to catch a glimpse of @DavidOtunga in a tux!!!
@Nimble_Mango two tears or red lips on my neck. #propalad
Think it's time to start thinking about a new tattoo. Six years have passed since the last!!! #halfsleeve
I just stare at the screen when watching an interview involving @ECB_cricket. The same things being churned out time and time again!!!
@Nimble_Mango @JoeH1985 To call it a ODI would suggest England could bat for 50 overs. Not too sure though. I'll be at Durham though!!!
If @DavidOtunga is back in @WWE, that's reason enough for me to start watching again!!!
With that red card at Pride Park, there goes the chances of my accumulator!!!

@carternufc @johnliddell1982 Don't care!!!
That catch was unreal. Should count as two wickets to help end this humiliation!!!
@JoeH1985 Nah man leave it on. 'Golden Boy' Broad and 'don't know why he plays', Woakes to save us!!!
The failings at @ECB_cricket stem from inept bowling/fielding. They have only taken 10 wickets in 4 of the last 15 ODI's!!! #CricketWorldCup
@SkySports The failings at @ECB_cricket stem from inept bowling/fielding. They have only taken 10 wickets in an ODI 4 times in 15 games!!!
@atoward Its the same English mentality as always. Looking to cautiously chase a high score. Lose wickets and then unfair pressure late on!!
Also, it frustrates me that they identify talent and then misuse it. Batting @benstokes38 at 8 or 9 and 5th bowler is a prime example!!!
I don't understand adjusting the batting order and omitting batsmen who specialise in a position to accommodate returning favourites!!!
Find it hard to relate to the @ECB_cricket at the moment. Young talent sent to the Lions while the same out of form players compete at #TWC!
Said before the the #CricketWorldCup that New Zealand would win the competition. Going through a very rosy period and looks set to continue!
Competition Time. Emma Frost would be my #marvelvalentine I❤️Marvel

@StuartMole5 If he brought on defensive players then he'd be accused of being negative and happy with a draw!!!
@StuartMole5 Seems as if Pardew can do no right though. We were in the ascendancy when he brought on two strikers ...
@StuartMole5 Was impressed again with Colback. We were simply picked off at the end. The were set up perfectly against us!!!
@LiamCostello95. Unable to motivate? I've not seen us start a game like that in either half for a while!!!

Awesome result for #NCLCUnited beating top of the league 4-2. Deserved every point!!!
I'm not expecting much from the #Patriots in the second either. They look deflated, void of confidence and ideas!!!
Pathetic first half by #Patriots. Ineffective running game and the pass has been telegraphed due to predictable outlets!!!
It's hard to see any self respecting manager wanting the job with Ashley in control. Itll be a case of same strings, different puppet! #NUFC

Perfect way to celebrate my Birthday Eve with a (not so surprise) trip to watch @DurhamCricket in action!!! http://t.co/fd3aqhzCP0

@DurhamCricket That's great, see you then!!!
@DurhamCricket @DCCCFans How much are tickets for the match against the University?
I've always thought I'd have a fighting chance during a standard zombie outbreak but those in #worldwarZ would have me beat no bother!!!
@Russell_Gilmore Saturday?
@Russell_Gilmore You'd hope so although they've beaten us more times than us them recently!!
@Russell_Gilmore I thought there was a possibility but the last thing they need to do is piss fans off ATM!!!
... especially when they choose to change the dates and offer no refund!!! http://t.co/COcvn7zDJx
... instead of making us fans wait longer to watch the sport we love simply prohibit the selection of international players for two weeks ..
Its a disgrace for the @ECB_cricket to postpone the county cricket season just so a handful of players get a rest ...
If @mcbridemelissa snuffs it in the @WalkingDead_AMC finale I'm boycotting season 5!!!

I have finally been reunited with @onm_uk since the years of the Gamecube. Welcome back into my life!!!
Also, how sexy is Carol? Girl got me thirsty for some!!! #TheWalkingDead
This weeks episode of The Walking Dead reminded me as to why I started watching. I was truly captivated by its intense and emotional story!!
@kaneorobinson Not that it compares to spitting but even so Meyer provoked Pardew with a shove!!!
@kaneorobinson Watching the footage again their heads were against one another's before AND after he spat!!!
@kaneorobinson From what I seen the spitting incident happened after the head touching!!!
It's quite simple really. Joe Hart avoids being punished by the @FA as doing so would mean limiting playing time before the world cup!!!

@_MartinDean I hope it's none other than @DavidOtunga!!!
Wordeo has potential but ATM there aren't enough videos for me!!!
@ZooeyDeschanel Happy Birthday to the most talented woman across the pond!!!
@robfnichols Newcastle College!!!
@robfnichols Next Friday in Sandyford!!!
@DaveyMc83 Cheers mate. A week to prepare!!!
@_MartinDean Newcastle College mate. Not going to let the nerves overwhelm me this time!!!
Just bagged myself an interview for a daytime job!!! #boom
Congrats England; oh no wait, you screwed up again!!!
So Joe Root finally makes a contribution in the tour of Australia!!!
RT @MizfitMathew: http://t.co/OHNGIt8Ou7
What is it with teams signing ex @Patriots players. Desperate tactics!!!
@robfnichols The one in the metro centre. I'm smell burgers and special offers!!!
@robfnichols Thanks for the heads up. Think I'm going to try The Fat Hippo on Jesmond. I've heard good things!!!
Brad Maddox is saving the show single handedly!!! #WWE
@kaneorobinson Nah mate. Is that a buffet of something?
Can anyone recommend a restaurant in the Newcastle/Jesmond area? Sick of eating at the same places!!! #nefollowers
It's annoying to hear 'if the goal was given you would have lost 2-1anyway'. Moronic opinions from moronic people!!!
Anyone else think the media buzz regarding Joe Harts performance vs. #NUFC is rather unjust? The Remy shot was straight at him!!!
RT @GeorgeLampshire: Joe Hart - "I saw him out the corner of my eye and it distracted me" #bollocks #liar
On to Denver we go!!! #patriots
Such a one sided game so far. Chargers need to at least put up a fight!!!
@IWFICON Ha, It must be!!! http://t.co/TeMNyrBk3E
@IWFICON I've just started watching from Series 1. It's seems I may as well stop now!!!
The @FA needs to introduce giving players a straight red if found guilty of simulation!!!
What a cheating prick Sterling is. I really hate watching football with all the gamesmanship and diving going on!!!
@robfnichols Indeed, the same thing happened two seasons ago. City get all the luck!!!
Time for some COD action to try and calm me down!!! #ironic
No way Man City deserve the win. Regardless, #NUFC stood tall today and battled to the end!!!
It seems Mike Jones still hasn't recovered from being poked in the eye by Sissoko. Either that or he's a bitter prick!!! #NUFC
@Suraj182 @NifferMonster Look at those bags. No wonder he fucked up. He was obviously up all night at for your eyes only!!!
Why can't we use video replays? In, cricket, tennis, rugby the NFL, decisions are reviewed and justice is done. Sort yourselves out @FA!!!
What a FUCKING joke!!!
Why didn't Williamson clear/block the cross? It was well within his reach!!! #NUFC
It seems #NUFC have now added orange boots to their home strip!!!
Cometh the day, cometh the man. Iron Mike to put Edin Dzeko in his pocket!!! #NUFC
It's only fitting that @elgalgojonas should be given a fantastic send off. Let him address the crowd he loved to play for!!! #NUFC
@johnliddell1982 The 49ers have Rick Flair, The Patriots have Hulkmania running through their veins!!!
Over on Sky Sports 2, someone tell Root this test match innings is a few weeks late!!!
Starting to feel the nerves now like. Let go @Patriots!!! #NFLPlayoffs
Where was the flag on the offence holding. It looked as if he was trying to remove the guys helmet!!!
BOOOM!!! A lead of 14 and Blount is killing it. Dat Amendola catch tho!!!
Now that's a hit!!! #NFLPlayoffs
@johnliddell1982 Glad you took it well!!!
@johnliddell1982 My bad mate for a lack of reply. Afraid I can't make it, busy before and after the match. Cheers though!!!
May as well stay up all night and watch the first ODI between #engvaus before the #NUFC match!!!
@elgalgojonas Many have came and gone, few have shown desire and joy to play for #NUFC. You gave us your all for 5 years. Thank you!!!
Friendly bit of advice for the Saints!!! @SkySportsNFL @nfl http://t.co/Gt1cfZkHED
@_MartinDean it was six and extended to thirteen!!!
@_MartinDean Keep it that way. The worst thing The Walking Dead did was extend the length of the series!!!
@_MartinDean Starting from series one!!'
Finally got round to watching Sherlock and my goodness it was worth the wait. Martin Freeman impresses once again!!!
@_MartinDean @Saints vs @Seahawks is the game of the playoffs however I have an affiliation with the @Patriots!!!
Coffee and jellies at the ready for the @nfl playoffs. Here's hoping the @Patriots make staying up till 4am worth while!!!
Cheers Blackpool. Nice one Cardiff!!! #brokenman
@robynsimpson @kaneorobinson I'm going to bind my feet like a Chinese woman to make sure they fit!!!
@kaneorobinson @robynsimpson Ha, I'm currently thinking the same thing Kane. Nothing wrong with breaking the gender barrier!!!
So it turns out the trainers I've saved up for are women's!!! #converse
And just like that I'm off to Dusseldorf/ Cologne and Leverkusen this May. Bring on the German stein!!!
@robfnichols Big mistake going there. They've sorted it and reluctantly gave us £50 off a rug!!!
Potentially another 6 hours to wait for the carpet fitter to fix errors made 2 months ago. Customer service at its best!!!
Watching footage of Solskjær vs #NUFC is making me resent the guy!!! #cheat
@robfnichols Follow @nufcfans for all #NUFC related news. It may make twitter a bit more interesting!!!
@alicelp48 Nah just wishful thinking. Think we find out on Feb 2nd!!!
I can't wait to fit into some of my old clothes. GNR14 training starts tomorrow at 6:45am!!!
Send the 49ers packing Green Bay (pun intended!!!) #NFL
@_MartinDean centre of trinity square!!!
@robfnichols He's sat front row, slurring his words!!!
First trip to the new VUE Gateshead cinema to see Frozen. Looking good but where is everyone?
It may not be Friday but give @robfnichols a follow. It should be entertaining watching him try to use Twitter!!!
@Bri_Marsha @alicelp48 @r_marston_ new_matthew What about @PoSHHuts for a trip away to the lakes some time soon?
RT @DCCCFans: Remove the use of central contracts and replace it with an extended match fee. Poor form; dropped, shouldn't get paid!!! #ash…
Shameful. Shred every central contract and use the money to refund the barmy army who would have payed almost £6000 to support England!!!
Pardew's decision to play a second string team better be because he is concentrating on the title!!! #NUFC
@Molie_NUFC We were both oiled up more than @RandyOrton!!!
@FrazerHallam Good lad, hope you celebrated with some cold ones!!!

I should be careful what I wish for though, Durham won't have enough front line bowlers!!! #Ashes
Surely on this showing the @ECB_cricket need to look at @BunnyOnions. I don't understand how they keep omitting him!!! #Ashes
It's ok, we always rebuild from this position (said no Englishman this series!!!) #ashes
@Nimble_Mango Don't forget the mighty West Indies. They're fighting to become 6th best in the world!!!
Watson just dropped the #Ashes!!!
I'm looking forward to the 'we haven't been good enough, we need to work harder, get ourselves back in the nets' press conference!!! #Ashes
Take a few early wickets before two or more batsmen bring up 100+ partnerships, Haddin gets a 50!!! #standard #Ashes
Get Stokes or Borthwick on!!!
I'm finding it hard to watch this 5th test match. Not because we are 4-0 down but because Mitchell Johnson has yet to shave!!!
Even if Monty Panesar is fit I would still select Borthwick. Bats at number 3 for Durham and an all round better athlete!!!
Let's hope Edge magazine and chicken soup can cure me of this #manflu!!! http://t.co/nK1Ofo1ONl
@carternufc @johnliddell1982 Show me how much it is and if I can't afford it ill just not eat to raise the cash!!!

Richly deserved selection for @Borthwick16 for his performances at number 3 and twirling the cherry this season!!!
Comprehensive wins for #NUFC and @Patriots this weekend putting me in an extra good mood for #christmas!!!

@atoward @kaylzj88 I think I was the only lad who was at work today. Where you thinking for yours?
No @BunnyOnions in another @ECB_cricket test squad despite another outstanding season for the County Champions. Pathetic decision!!!
STAG STAG STAG STAG!!!
@kaneorobinson Good lad. Start as you mean to go on!!!
Love this shot of @DurhamCricket celebrating championship success once again. Thank you @Colly622 and the lads!!! http://t.co/SHR2yCHRiL
Favourites for relegation they said. Would struggle without an oversees player they said. What a season for @DurhamCricket. Well done boys!!
Its all over bar the shouting. Wish I was at @DurhamCricket to join in with the celebrations!!!
I will never tire of Notting Hill (The Movie!!!)
I can't believe its the start of my stag weekend tomorrow. STAG STAG STAG STAG!!!
@johnliddell1982 @carternufc @rosslaurie86 @Peaza01 Ha, where do you find this stuff!!!
One word to describe @DurhamCricket this morning: Ruthless!!!
Good luck @durhamcricket. Go well in front of the home support and lets make history. It's in our own hands!!!
@kaneorobinson I hope that's just the appetiser!!!
I can't wait to see Steve McDonald in HD. Some people were born to look good on TV!!!
@JonFleming86 You are the devil on my shoulder!!!
Do I sacrifice this weeks food budget for GTA V? I won't exactly be eating much other than cheesy balls and drinking Monster!!!

After watching the #MOTD highlights, Ashley Young gives us a few more reasons as to why we should hate him. Cheating scum!!!
What a performance by @DurhamCricket Simply outstanding. Put in performances like that and you deserve the championship!!!
@picadil85 As long as I have my decency intact and a pillow the gutter is fine. What you doing over there?
@picadil85 Meant to say next weekend mate. I'm expecting a few quiet beers (said no stag ever!!!)
@picadil85 Ha I've taken that nickname as a compliment. What a tash. Stag is next week and Wedding is on 12th October!!!
@picadil85 Ha I've taken that nickname as a compliment. What a tash. Stag is last week and Wedding is on 12th October!!!

... Teams would then only take the risk if they are sure a batsmen is out. Less tactical reviews/controversy, more control for umpires!!!
The review system should be changed. Instead of losing a review, it should be passed on to the opposition (unless umpires call) ... #Ashes

Annoyed by the performance of #NUFC? Put a smile on your face for the next two hours by going straight to E4+1!!!
After that performance Cabaye to leave #nufc is far more likely. Question is, who's next out the door once there head is turned!!!
By the sounds of it, tonight's MOTM could have played for the loosing side!!! #Krul
Anita should be ahead of Jonas. What more does the guy need to do!!! #NUFC
If we lose Cabaye to Arsenal it means our next signing needs to ooze talent and be ridiculously good looking!!! #NUFC

@robynsimpson I'd love to lie and say I've been waiting for ages but me and @_xXcarolineXx_ have just arrived. You are even later!!! #tuttut
@robynsimpson @Russell_Gilmore Been awake since 6:30am and have even ironed my clothes. Got to look sharp in Las Scarborough!!!
Gutted to be missing out on #NCLCUnited preseason but a little trip to Scarborough awaits!!!
The 13/14 #NUFC Home Kit makes me want to cry!!!
@JoeBusby2707 I have to wait until next weekend to taste preseason. Im absolutely ravenous!!!
@JoeBusby2707 Your profile pic makes me want you!!!
It feels good to finally get on the property ladder. One step closer to the Iron-Mansion in Malibu!!!
@vodafoneuk Ever since I took out this contract my signal has been absolutely pathetic. Sort it out please!!!
@CANVisEffects You get my texts?
@kaneorobinson I've never actually seen you and @TaylorR1984 in the same room together. I need this to happen soon to quell my suspicions!!!
@craigsimpson42 Thats exactly how it panned out, were you watching over my shoulder?
@carternufc Its going to be hard to convince @_xXcarolineXx_ to get lil Charmander like!!!
Today consists of signing the contract for my first home!!! #beyondexcited
@picadil85 @rosslaurie86 @carternufc @carl_rich Nothing special about that average rating like!!!
@tfc_13 Fancy this in August? http://t.co/71ZJby5gYI
Starting to get concerned with the offence options for the #Patriots. Welker at the Broncos, Hernandez in court and Gronk needing surgery!!!
@atoward Like a road covered in fresh Tarmac!!!
@picadil85 Ha exactly, especially when they're not finished!!!
@picadil85 Its the standard Mel C type tribal bands that get my goat. Suppose it was once fashionable!!!
@kaneorobinson @robynsimpson What are you doing phoning after my bed time ha. What's up bud?
@kaneorobinson @robynsimpson What ever do you mean?
@robynsimpson @kaneorobinson We can give them our version of the red arrows!!!
@robynsimpson @kaneorobinson Just seen this advertised. It may not be our cup of tea but its an option!!! http://t.co/9M9CnW30I2
@robynsimpson Nothing concrete. Maybe an Italian and an evening out around town? As for the day, down by the seafront/ surfing/ shopping?
@robynsimpson @kaneorobinson @Russell_Gilmore Get yourself down to Scarborough Bay and get that Donkey doing some sick jumps!!!
@kaneorobinson @robynsimpson @Russell_Gilmore Tickets booked for the cricket at the value of £15 each!!! http://t.co/6JpzOs5ME6
Finally booked TWENTY20 tickets for @DurhamCricket vs @Yorkshireccc this Sunday in what will be my first ever away match!!!
I always enjoy a burst of laughter that involves liquid spraying from my mouth!!!
I've just been reminded of the scene in Kevin and Perry Go Large which has haunted me for years!!! #whitehead
What a joke of a batting performance. Typical England throwing it away again. Now I know how it feels to be South African!!! #EngvInd
It would be very much like England to throw this one away. Shades of 2004 against the West Indies!!!
@25lisa85 Great. So that's £75 for the Pokemon White bundle and Mario64 DS. See you tomorrow!!!
@25lisa85 I'd take £10. How's does that sound?
@25lisa85 Thought I'd mention if you were interested I have Mario64 for the DS as well. If not don't worry about it :)
@25lisa85 Hey, thought I'd follow you so you can recognise me tomorrow. In summary, 10:30am next to JD Sports?
Fantastic customer service by #Apple. Broken charger; in and out within 3 minutes with a replacement!!!
@MaTTmOOre1992 Nah, straight to ASDA to create a beast of a pizza!!! #cheatmeal
Totally smashed my personal best in the #GreatNorth10K by 4:36 after crossing the line in 51:46. Think that calls for a celebration!!!
Congrats to everyone who ran in the #GreatNorth10K and thanks to those who cheered me on when running up the mountains!!!
Went for the some classic hits to get me over the line. Lets hope Bonnie Tyler, Europe and Survivor justify their purchase!!! #Gateshead10k
Just had to turn down an offer for my DSi that consisted of a selection of second hand cosmetics and half the asking price!!! #illpassthanks
@Bashamole Ha it's certainly appropriate but I doubt it'll give me the adrenaline boost I will so desperately need!!!
Time to construct a playlist that will get me through tomorrow's 10K. Open to suggestions like!!!
@DurhamCricket The Twenty20 match away to Yorkshire!!!
@DurhamCricket Can I buy tickets on the door or is it likely to sell out?
@TaylorR1984 You do look like @kaneorobinson though!!!
Hmmm!!! #TheVoice
Watching @DurhamCricket cruise to victory whilst cooking for the misses has to be one of my most enjoyable evenings for a while!!!
Now that's a batting card to be proud of!!! #cricketcaptain http://t.co/j9uKcO7cy7

No point in watching #theapprentice anymore. Beaten down by two spiteful bitches!!!
@robynsimpson @kaneorobinson I've spoken to @Russell_Gilmore and we have thought of a compromise. You ok to meet at ASDA - 10:30?
@robynsimpson @kaneorobinson Im game for that. Bit breakfast in the cafe and then hit the road?
@kaneorobinson @robynsimpson Well it takes about 2 hours to get to Scarborough so how about we meet at Boldon ASDA at 12pm and stock up?
@robynsimpson Once we're there we check in and pay for the room and buy a ticket from the box office. After that the town is our oyster!!!
@robynsimpson It might be the case we take down 3 cars so everyone is in control of when they leave and/ or where they go!!!
@robynsimpson Can't wait either. Still waiting to hear back from @Russell_Gilmore and @kaneorobinson as to who wants to drive down!!!
Couldn't have been luckier with the fixtures as there is an international break on the day of my wedding!!!!
@JoeBusby2707 Call me 'Tank' from now on. I'm going to roll them over!!!
That's 6 miles in the bag for Sunday. At least I know I can cross the line. The only question now is how fast can I do it!!!

@DurhamCricket How much for an adult ticket this Sunday against Scotland?
@DurhamCricket I am overjoyed with that victory. Couldn't handle the tension. I don't care how foolish I look doing my fist pumps at work!!!
If I was an Essex fan I'd be pretty furious right now!!!
Come on @DurhamCricket. All we need is 3 wickets!!!
Where the hell is my mind at. Why didn't I remember that Man of Steel is out today!!!
Since I'd still rather take my pants and underwear off in public than my T-shirt, operation #moobloss will have to be taken up a gear!!!

@nufcfans Chelsea, simply for Benitez who has showed class unlike the supporters who called for his head after one week in charge!!!
@Molie_NUFC I can't believe they pulled it off. If this is true they can take my money!!!
@petemck86 I'd say keep Pardew next season and see which season was a fluke. Get it right in the summer and I'm hopeful!!!
Gutted for Martinez but happy Wigan are down (simply for Whelan). Hope he leaves and becomes Manager of Everton!!!
Good riddance to Wigan. Good luck playing a minimum of 46 games and then the addition of Europe. Back to back relegations?
@team_penaluna @carl_rich @carternufc My tash may as well not be there!!!
C'mon Wigan. Just one more goal needed. Get Watson off the bench!!!
@GMMJohnson Ok mate. Ill speak to the guy who is sorting it. What do you normally expect for your services?
@GMMJohnson Approximately 4pm mate and if interested do you charge?
@GMMJohnson Hey, I know youve done photography at football matches. Would you be interested in taking photos for my team on May 26th at SJP?
@nufcfans The sponsor is probably the best part. Another boring design that will be seen on many other teams but in a different colour!!!
@DCCCFans For me the MOTM is @Borthwick16. Those wickets were vital to ensure we didn't chase too big a total!!!

@Nimble_Mango I'd agree there mate. The thing I enjoyed most was practicing trying to control possession and not forcing the play!!!
@Nimble_Mango Aye mate, why you ask?
I was a bit disappointed with Phil Jones' face when he lifted the trophy. It was too normal!!! #MUFC
@nikilye I reckon Wigan can do it like and if they do, Martinez deserves to be knighted!!!
@Russell_Gilmore Its more relief for me like. Nothing to celebrate!!!
@MaTTmOOre1992 @Molie_NUFC Who's Shane?

@mjwinning11 @nufcfans You'd have thought that against Villa in 08/09. Lets hope for a less inept and depressing performance against QPR!!!
As much as I have no time for Whelan I'm delighted for Martinez. It should have been him lifting the cup!!!
Devastated. I watch 90 minutes of the #facupfinal before leaving to pick up @_xXcarolineXx_ and miss the decisive goal!!!
@DaveyMc83 I suspect he would be rather jealous of my receding hairline!!!
@official_rjk ITV producers can only dream of burning his contract!!!

Perfect way to finish a season. A 5-0 victory in what can only be described as the most boring game ever (I was in goal!!)! #NCLCUnited
I intend too!!! http://t.co/Hxq0T4MXHQ

Last game of the season for #NCLCUnited (@NewcastleCLC)  tonight. Come along and watch us see off our inaugural season in style!!!
So that's Sessegnon and Gardner missing the rest of the season as well as Cuellar and Larsson out for Southampton!!! #NUFC
Football league predictor sends Norwich down, providing #NUFC get 3 points at #QPR!!!
@kaneorobinson Good shout mate. Ain't paying eBay prices since half its worth is based on nostalgia!!!
My quest for a #N64 continues. Blue Flames Car Boot had everything but!!!
Turning up for your copy of @CallingSpots with a semi on!!! #standard
@_MartinDean Reminds me too much of our top from the 10/11 season. Hated it. This is what I'm talking 'bout!!! http://t.co/A8RdORHqmj
@NUFCrumours Happy with that. It looks awful on the orange Blackpool top!!!
@_MartinDean I can't stand any of the 'leaked' tops. I'm hoping for a black Wonga logo in a mostly black top!!!
I hope the sponsor logo on the #NUFC top for next season can be adapted as seen on the new Hearts' top!!! http://t.co/bV5700XtQJ
I'd planned on enjoying an afternoon of football but now I see @DurhamCricket are live on Sky Sports. Let go Dynamos!!!
@kaneorobinson Its not just consistency. If a player can be that passionate about Wigan then he's a professional who just loves football!!!
I've said for weeks now Maloney is a quality player. His performance against WBA just reinforces past superlatives!!!
@ita8dgr @JoeBusby2707 Best get my gloves prepped for Tuesday then!!!
Ever since the final of @MasterChefUK I can't stop listening to @swedemason and the epic #butterybiscuitbase!!!
@JoeBusby2707 @ita8dgr @sullivancharlie Perfect plan. May even stick some flavour in the water to make up for last time!!!
@ita8dgr @JoeBusby2707 @sullivancharlie The water bottles are in good hands. Promise not to forget them but remind me just incase!!!
@JillwilkGillian Perfect video in case you and the kids go to see IM3 “@clarkgregg: Catch up for IM3 in 3 minutes.  http://t.co/jzdYpTPftf”
There must be a mistake. There seems to be a number 3 in front of the number in which @ZooeyDeschanel should be listed in FHMs sexist women!
@official_rjk Exactly, I'd rather Mae Young than Rosie Webster any day!!! #toofar
It appears UK males still have very poor taste in women. Tulisa last year and now Helen Flanagan. Look past the pout!!! #FHM
@peterjobes So am I mate. Just thought I'd put it out there. Would make it an interesting concept and possibly get more bums on seats!!!
@atoward Can't believe they've done it. They can barely get passed 150 when they've got as many overs as possible!!!
@MichaelVaughan Your opinion on a theoretical change to 4 day County Cricket, if one innings was replaced with a maximum of 20 overs?
Would anybody welcome the change in 4 day County Cricket, if one innings was replaced with a maximum of 20 overs? #hybrid
What a performance by @DurhamCricket and the explosive innings by @mark26stone and @colonel19. Enjoy the celebrations!!!
@CallingSpots Can I pop round this weekend mate and pick up issue 4 and 5 and possibly the money for the stag?
RT @CallingSpots: Our mate Randy Pawton is loving his early copy of Calling Spots 5. Order YOURS today at http://t.co/evtVirLUSV

RT? http:…
These run chases are the worst. Hope @DurhamCricket open with @colonel19 and @benstokes38 for some big hitting!!!
Had the best dream scene in a while. Male #Zombies could only be killed with a shot to the groin as we all know men think with their dicks!!
If people could see how I danced once I close the door behind they'd have me in a straitjacket!!!
Y'all need this in your life!!! #toetapper http://t.co/EvtmPZtogi
@DurhamCricket Something tells me @mawood33 could finish this tonight!!! #pumpedup
@Proteinmonk At least its better than the Geordie Shore brigade modelling All Saints et al!!!
RT @Leesy7NUFC: @stevewraith total tossers just looking to stir things up #shithousenewspaper
RT @Leesy7NUFC: Really ? so he's not allowed to wear the team he supports kit in a local gym laughing with friends @stevewraith http://t.co…
@nufcfans I hate every one of them. Boring and lazy designs by PUMA!!!
@JoeBusby2707 Exactly, made himself big and all that but the ball just hit him!!!
I must be the only person in the world that thinks the #Lopez save was average!!!
Ring the Bells by James is today's #SOTD!!!
@_MartinDean Was disappointed to hear from another that it was standard 3D glasses. Your opinion on the Mandarin?
@_MartinDean Glad to hear it lived up to the hype!!!
Alan Pardew loves a spot of gardening and hates football allegedly in the @ECB_cricket #whatzat game!!! #NUFC http://t.co/rcY0QJDpHF
Is it just me or would anyone else drop Cisse for Shola against #WHFC? Much better choice against a physical side!!! #NUFC
I may start watching RAW live, simply for @racheljane_xo commentary/perving on the #hunksintrunks!!!
@Bashamole They've even got a chance to get a point against Arsenal. They've been here before, they can handle the pressure!!!
Based on Wigan's final four games I believe they can get 7 points, beating WBA and Swansea and a draw against Villa!!! #NUFC
@official_rjk On top form discussing his exercises!!!
@carternufc Jealous? Not for long!!!
@doddsy1991 I know, I hope some show themselves as morons, blinded by hatred, failing to realise the predicament they themselves are in!!!
@Nimble_Mango We all need to get @tfc_13 tattoos to prove our dedication!!!
I look forward to deluded #SAFC fans expressing there delight at a defeat that plunges #NUFC further in the mire!!!
@Nimble_Mango Believe me. Dean running me into the ground would be preferable to work!!!
Dead Man Down has been described as 'the best revenge thriller in years'. It's all down to @WadeBarrett and his Oscar worthy performance!!!
@nufcfans He is only saying this incase Pardew is sacked and he is asked to come back to save our season!!!
#NUFC should sit John Carver down like the monkey in the opening scene of 28 days later just before the pre match team talk!!! #firedup
@kaneorobinson Is there a reason your refusing to let slip the name of this guy?
@kaneorobinson There's a reason though you have to pay for top managers. Those out of a job have been sacked for a reason!!!
@kaneorobinson @robynsimpson Only one thing bothered me somewhat but managed to accept it and enjoy the rest immensely!!!
@kaneorobinson Bum chum Whelan would want a pretty penny. Add that to the 7 year contract Ashley would have to settle!!!
@BlondieRodge There's only one person I'd want and his name is Roberto Martinez!!!
@kaneorobinson There's only one person I'd want and his name is Roberto Martinez!!!
@robynsimpson @kaneorobinson Perfect answer!!!
@robynsimpson @kaneorobinson More important, what did you think?
@robynsimpson @kaneorobinson It doesn't. Auld Lang Syne was played on midnight eve in Switzerland. Cant recall Mambo Number 5 though!!!
Somewhat disappointed with the #ironman3 soundtrack as both the epic trailer music and Eiffel 65 are absent!!!
Only 25 hours till pay day and then I can live again. Five weekend months are a bastard!!!
@petemck86 If you do go down that path, a few pints before ice skating breaks the ice!!! #imhearallweek
@petemck86 Me and the wife to be!!!
Lets go #Celtics. Need to improve on the D#!!!
@GMMJohnson Seen the pics mate. My dream is to go to Massachusetts like to watch the @Patriots and @celtics!!!
@GMMJohnson @racheljane_xo What a fantastic incentive to come over!!! #bubbles
@GMMJohnson @racheljane_xo Snuck it on while she left the room just in time to see those monster 3's!!!
@racheljane_xo Cheers, unfortunately im not in charge of the remote so relying on updates!!! #underthethumb
@racheljane_xo Whats the Playoff score?
@ita8dgr Glad I could help mate. Congrats on the time, you deserve that curry!!!
@petemck86 Cheap bastard wouldn't make a blu-ray though!!!
@petemck86 Both as bad as each other then. Although I wouldn't be surprised if they made it a local holiday!!!
@_MartinDean She is my Quicksilver!!!
So proud of @_xXcarolineXx_ today. Completely smashed her PB by 8/9 minutes!!! #athlete
I'm pretty sure the #NUFC club shop didn't do this after any victory against the unwashed!!! #pathetic http://t.co/6lCOTM1Y2w
@kaneorobinson I thought some of the abuse directed at Sunderland was exaggerated but after visiting, what a shit hole!!!
Good luck to my gorgeous lil runner @_xXcarolineXx_ in the Sunderland 10K. Here's hoping for a personal best!!!
“@atoward: I could play better on Fifa than what #NUFC played today against #LFC . I am shit at FIFA” He is REALLY shit!!!
@atoward Cisse!!!
@MaTTmOOre1992 People say its the players on the pitch but there attitude gave the impression they aren't happy with Pardew and his tactics!
@atoward I'd accept that excuse if they were all different nationalities but 8 spoke French. The only points I see us getting are QPR!!!
For those saying sack Pardew now expecting the Di Canio effect. Remember Shearer!!! #NUFC
Pardew sat and watched ESPN post match analysis and regurgitated what was said!!! #NUFC
Lets see what Pardew has to say. Will he be wearing his rose tinted glasses!!! #NUFC
For weeks I've tried to look for the positives and support Pardew but this performance is truly embarrassing. Cisse is a moron!!! #NUFC
Can anyone tell me what Sissoko has done since Chelsea? #NUFC
@TOONTRAVEL2 Too many players playing on past reputation and not on form!!!
I know its the players that aren't performing but errors in team selection and a lack of player cohesion are down to Pardew!!! #NUFC
@alicelp48 I know but I've done no training for weeks now. Ill make it up to you with the Gateshead 10K!!!
Thank god for that Wigan OG!!! #NUFC
It's also gratifying when you beat a team who's captain calls you a fat fuck for no reason!!!
A great 4-3 victory by #NCLCUnited today. Lets use the momentum to climb the league and secure that Europa League spot!!!
@_MartinDean Hey, was meant to be going but totally skint so a night in my workshop it is. Cheers for the invite though!!!
@_MartinDean Will do mate!!!
@_MartinDean Middlesborough, Silverlink. It might have just been since it was the premier!!!
@_MartinDean There's my boys. Got Stark and Iron Man!!!
@_MartinDean No idea mate. I hope for you they are standard for everyone watching #ironman3!!!
Take a bow, Chalobah!!! #lcfc #wfc
Fantastic innings so far by Stoneman and Jennings, building a lead and confidence!!!
@nufcfans Could you please RT to raise awareness and get people following @tfc_13, a team joining the Tyneside Amateur league next season!!!
@the_dilsh Could you please RT to raise awareness and get people following @tfc_13, a team joining the Tyneside Amateur league next season!!
RT @harraharrison: Could people follow @tfc_13 premier league here we come!!!
Please follow @tfc_13 and show your support for the team next season!!!
Two of my favourite marvel characters merged as one!!! #Deadpool #Ironman http://t.co/nqPai1i81V
@_MartinDean At work I'm afraid. Got my hands on the Tony Stark and Iron Man glasses. Found myself looking on the floor for the other two!!!
@_MartinDean TBH it wasn't exactly enhanced by 3D although you may get some awesome 3D glasses!!!
Guess who's been used as the thumbnail for the Iron Man 3 UK tour experience video!!! #famous #marvel #ironman3 http://t.co/qyZjZslh3u
Just imagine Suarez's appetite to play again after his 10 game ban!!! #nom
@_MartinDean Must admit I wasn't exactly blown away with the initial Thor trailer!!!
@_MartinDean Already seen it mate. Unbelievably awesome!!!
The guy in the cubicle wearing headphones obviously isn't aware of how loudly he is grunting!!!
@CallingSpots I've a spare £5 in my bank account which means ive no excuse not to purchase issue 4 and 5 tomorrow!!!
@johnliddell1982 I can't decide between 1,2,6 and 7. My eyes are greedy and want them all!!!
The games keep coming. Salivating at the news of LEGO Marvel Super Heroes!!!
Finally, Deadpool gets some attention in the self titled game. Please Activision/High Moon, don't let me down!!!
@carternufc Oh yeah. I want the guy from Waterboy to be near me when I'm feeling weak!!! #youcandoit
Giving up the drink until my stag (20th Sept) in an attempt to save and get trim. Don't be a hurdle encouraging me to give in. Support me!!!
@SkySports Can you explain why there has been no County Cricket coverage, despite the season being two weeks old?
@ForbiddenPlanet @_MartinDean Quite the relief. Where would I spend all my wages if it was true!!! #stupiddream
@_MartinDean @ForbiddenPlanet Ive heard nothing that would give my subconscious to dream up such a thing!!!
Woke up in a hot sweat after dreaming @ForbiddenPlanet had closed down in Newcastle!!!
Peeling glue of your fingers isn't as fun when you substitute PVA for hot glue!!! #blisters
@carl_rich @carternufc @team_penaluna Ill never forget my beating but was confused by the aforementioned girl!!
@team_penaluna @carternufc @carl_rich Eh?
@atoward This can't be true. Averaging 6 runs between 4 batsmen for the last 16 innings. Sort it out!!! http://t.co/JzyQGWZaKp
A rather successful evening at Newcastle Dogs, leaving 10p up!!!
The only spoiler ill give away about #ironman3 is that @GwynethPaltrow is absolutely stunning!!!
@ita8dgr You making a comeback?
@Nimble_Mango @joeh1985 @mattmoore1992 @molie_nufc Can't wait to get all over that!!!
@petemck86 Seen it at the Premier Middlesborough. It was epic!!!
This #ironman3 come down is awful. Thanks to #marvel though for wetting my appetite again by releasing this!!! #Thor http://t.co/qonVsfqNDo
Back to reality!!!
@JonFleming86 If you chose the former this will be my last ever tweet to you!!!
@kaneorobinson if you're not careful I may get verbal diarrhoea!!!
@kaneorobinson No spoilers in that!!
Shane Black. You are a hero!!! #ironman3
Fjdthjllhklvdadjk hadnkgsvh!!! #ironman3

No updates are always a good thing when Durham are batting. Least you know then they haven't lost a wicket!!!
The long wait is over. Today is the day that's all about me and #ironman3!!!
Less than 24 hours until I witness #ironman3 in all its glory at the world premier (in Middlesborough)!!! #marvel
@kaneorobinson Awesome news. Added the cast that already includes Batista!!!
@Nimble_Mango Can't mate. Stuck at work until 9pm. Cheers though!!!
@Jon_Favreau If you liked that watch The Thick of It. It's the British version Veep is loosely based on!!!

My dreams have came true; Iron Man 3 this Thursday!!!
@_MartinDean I know but they stood out for me!!!
I'm not going to say drop or sell anyone as thats pathetic but today Gutierrez, Sissoko, Cabaye and Cisse had a shocker!!!
Play Cisse in midfield and then maybe he will be onside!!! #NUFC #TyneWearDerby
@SkySports Please explain your decision to employ the services of Niall Quinn during the #tynewearderby. Talk about bias!!!
Things that have pissed me off during #tynewearderby. Listening to the bias #NiallQuinn for 90 minutes and Mr Offside (@CissePapiss)!!!
Piss off Redknapp. @YGouffran went to control the ball, no way he meant to do that!!! #NUFC #tynewearderby
Had to eat something in an attempt to displace the feeling of butterflies. It didn't work. Drink it is!!! #NUFC #TyneWearDerby
If @NUFCOfficial played Chachalala by @WWEFandango, it would make tomorrows derby even more spectacular!!! #fandangorevolution #NUFC
@TheGymGroup I play for Tynemouth FC and I'm looking for £25 player sponsorship for the coming season. If possible could I talk to someone?
Fantastic result for @DurhamCricket. Lets hope its the first of many this campaign!!!
@JoeBusby2707 @timbo_carr @ita8dgr @daveymc83 @sullivancharlie @callmejonnyf Stay safe in Sunderland boys and come back with 3 points!!!
Hope @kaneorobinson and @Russell_Gilmore haven't asked for extra garlic on their Nachos!!!
@Russell_Gilmore @kaneorobinson Brace yourselves!!! #NUFC http://t.co/tIRUfipfv7
Brace yourselves!!! #NUFC http://t.co/tIRUfipfv7
C'Mon #NUFC. Keep this momentum, keep the pressure and above all keep the faith!!!
I've got a lot of time for Chris Coleman. Was always a fan when he was at Fulham and for some reason reminds me of Pierce Brosnon!!!
I ain't his biggest fan but lets get behind Williamson. Being benched will have knocked his confidence. Last thing he needs is abuse!! #NUFC
15 Days!!! #countdown
What a stunning performance by the @DurhamCricket bowlers. Lets push on and try to bat them out of the game!!!
@NaatWilliams We need to get people on it. Down 1 place since last night. Vive la #FandangoRevolution!!!
@NifferMonster Got to be the 95/96 top. One of my favorites  Always reminds me of David Ginola!!!
@Bri_Marsha What's this?
@johnliddell1982 Even those who were casual bystanders on the train would have went home humming!!! #fandangorevolution

@johnliddell1982 You fancy setting up a duet? I've heard Juxtaposition Records are in town looking for a new sound!!!
Still 16 days until Iron Man 3. Please someone put me to sleep so I don't have to wait any longer!!!
Recently @SomersetCCC have been colossus with the bat against @DurhamCricket. It all changes today in swinging conditions!!!
Hopefully with @HEELZiggler earning the WHC it will bring back the respect the strap deserves!!! #WWE
I've been waiting 6 months for the return of the County Championship. Heres hoping @DurhamCricket return to the summit this season!!!

Did I miss Team Rhodes Scholars!!! #WWE #wrestlemania
Why don't they use the $79.99 promo chair for these shots!!! #WWE #WrestleMania
@MaTTmOOre1992 Basic!!!
That match was unbelievable. If #CMPunk can't beat the streak the streak deserves to live on!!! #WWE #wrestlemania
No sign of @HEELZiggler upsets me but if @CMPunk breaks the streak I'll forgive Vince!!! #WWE #WrestleMania
Canny deflated like watching Hell No retain. Ziggler better cash in!!! #WWE #Wrestlemania29
This Wrestlemania will be epic if Scholars, Lesner and Cena win, Ziggler cashes in and Punk breaks the streak!!!
I love watching Bobby Zamora's version of the Brogue Kick. Gomez down for the 3 count!!! #WWE
On a day that has already seen #NUFC beat #FFC, #Wrestlemania is only a few hours away. Today is a good day!!! #WWE
@alicelp48 Glad to hear @_xXcarolineXx_ allows you girls to have some fun in her invitation sweatshop!!!
Does anyone know why #QPR morons are booing Gomez? If they believe he got Zamora sent off they are completely deluded!!! #WAFC
@CANVisEffects Well then tell me what one is first and don't lie!!!
@CANVisEffects I'm not. It's not difficult to just get a coast metro!!!
@CANVisEffects If you go to Palmersville. I ain't got much petrol!!!
Lets hope its a draw in the QPR Vs Wigan game giving us some breathing distance!!! #NUFC
@CANVisEffects OK, see you at Palmersville for a lift home?
@CANVisEffects Mothers buying an Indians. Do you want anything to reheat when you get here?
Even before the goal I thought our performance merited a victory. Resilient at the back and a threat going forward!!! #NUFC

Bank Holiday has so far been awesome. Saved Air Force One as Iron Man and now in Krispy Kreme to celebrate!!!
@GMMJohnson Promoting Iron Man 3 and the merch in the Disney store!!!
@GMMJohnson Go to the Metro Centre to be motion captured as Iron Man. Loved it!!!
@Whoispol Its awesome like. Top of the class they said!!!
@DaveyMc83 Just about mate. Few whiskers stuck out the helmet but used my repulser ray to trim them!!!
I am ridiculously excited about becoming #ironman!!!
World War Z looks the tits like. Just hope it does Max Brooks justice!!!
I like to pretend I'm Max Branning when walking round my house!!! #scrape
#Marvel!!! The Wolverine doesn't have me salivating. Make Old Man Logan!!!
Listening to the Blues Brothers soundtrack whilst doing a spot of spring cleaning should make me question my life's priorities!!!
Ready for the bank holiday!!! http://t.co/T5Q6pvlV9L
Every time I open a McVitie's Gold biscuit I can't help but pretend im Martin Kemp in Spandau Ballet!!!
@_MartinDean It must be some sort of promo event at the Metro Centre. It's on Friday and Saturday!!!
On Friday I will become Iron Man at the Metro Centre. It may only be via motion capture but one day the suit will be mine!!!
@CallingSpots I'm not sure mate. Trying to get people to come along!!!
@CANVisEffects I ain't going by myself. Ill pick you up from South Gosforth. I've got the day off!!!
@CANVisEffects Shark Bar then? May be an decent atmosphere as opposed to the noise of the escalator!!!
First thing I'm buying on pay day is Issue 4 of @CallingSpots fanzine. Wonder if Mark Henry has discovered antiperspirant!!!
Just discovered the app Pokemon TV and the best thing is its free. Sadly there's no footage of the Pokérap!!! (@antanddec)
Can anyone tell me if Bioshock Infinite is a stand alone game or is it linked with the first two?
It needs to hurry up and be pay day. A litre bottle of Morgan Spice is cheaper than the 70cl bottle. Perfect for the bank holiday!!!

Sat watching the worst ever game of 5aside on my lunch break. About 25 minutes gone, 0 goals!!!
It's getting closer. Fixture card in the wallet so I never miss @DurhamCricket!!! http://t.co/O1x2YyJiy8
@Timbo_Carr Ill be devastated if I'm standing on the sideline holding orange segments!!!
Little things amuse me!!! http://t.co/OtipOWPDfl
Leg is battered and bruised so I think a weeks rest is on the cards. Got to get fit for #NCLCUnited on Saturday!!!
@JoeH1985 Probably in a couple weeks mate. Give Dean a text and he'll keep you in the loop!!!
A lovely 5-2 victory for #TynemouthFC before the Easter break. Need to find some balls though after dropping my arse!!! #lovernotafighter
I may not be Cupid but I hope @KaitlynWWE gets with @CodyRhodesWWE like!!!
A jug left unattended means its my jug!!!
@JoeBusby2707 @ita8dgr I'm disappointed with the picture you sent based on your description!!!
@JoeBusby2707 Cum (hehe) please!!! http://t.co/r9RPtZD1hr
@JoeBusby2707 Can't contain it after a few stowbows!!!
Upset that my partner @JoeBusby2707 will not be joining me in tonight's antics!!! #heartbroken
Champagne bubbles have entered my system!!! #tipsy
Totally forgot to mention that I scored my 3rd of the season. Still gutted though. Team first, personal achievement second!!! #NCLCUnited
A draw that feels like a defeat. So deflated!!! #NCLCUnited
I dreamt I was in a Fallout 3/ Pokemon RPG being chased by Koffing whilst giving @the_dilsh a life home. I wanna go back to sleep!!!
Home and now in the workshop armed with a hot glue gun listening to #ACDC. Things may get messy!!!
@_MartinDean Reading Starburst and they mentioned Sandler or Jim Carey. Hoping for a cheeky Batista Bomb now though!!!
@_MartinDean Well my information is out of date!!!
For the sake of the #Marvel Universe DO NOT cast Adam Sandler as Drax the Destroyer in Guardians of the Galaxy!!!
@alicelp48 It bitterly cold like so get the leggings on!!!
I've found myself reacting like a post match @WadeBarrett once I finish my run!!! #pumped #boooom
@CANVisEffects Outside main gates!!!
@CANVisEffects Going home first to get the bags. See you at school at 3:30ish!!!
It's amazing how one compliment can boost your self esteem!!!
@CANVisEffects brilliant!!!
@CANVisEffects Do me a favour and take with you Caroline's orange bag please so I don't have to go home!!!
@CANVisEffects Ill be in from 3.30 so whenever. Preferably ASAP!!!
@CANVisEffects I was thinking a bottle of whisky from Fenwicks and a cigar from the place next to FP amongst other things!!!
@CANVisEffects I've got possibly £60. Ill come to mothers but after we go to nana Nichols?
@CANVisEffects Meet at 3.30pm outside the gate. How much have you to spend?
@nufcfans Any charge for Graham Barrows? It was his intervention that started the melee!!! #NUFC
As for John Carver, he was simply voicing his disgust in a relatively controlled manner. Graham Barrows intervention escalated matters!!!
Can someone also tell me why #mcmanaman wasn't booked for the deliberate handball moments after his shocking challenge. Inept officials!!!
RT @danwhitejourno: Ben Thatcher. Callum McManaman. Sixth paragraph. What's the difference?  http://t.co/Vkz8XXKk9P #nufc
I hate to say I told you so but once again the @fa how shown themselves to be predictable and completely incompetent!!! #NUFC
RT @Molie_NUFC: 5 mile run down the coast in this weather but I feel better for it! #witnessthefitness #TynemouthFC
Evening run down the coast with the #TynemouthFC boys. Tynemouth steps, priory hill sprints and a 5 mile run has me knackered!!! #worthit
@Its_paige Plenty @CodyRhodesWWE and Brad Maddox will make me a happy boy!!!
It's a travesty Steve McDonald is not doing the full monty!!! #coronationstreet
Haidara deflected the ball off McManaman and even then there was minimum deviation. Shocking challenge. Fuck you Whelan!!! #NUFC
Decision would be left to an independent committee, free from the useless and biased @fa to determine the extent of malice!!!
Regarding yesterday's horror challenge I think the person responsible should be banned for as long as the victim is out injured!!! #NUFC
@rvmoficial Hola, soy un Rayo Vallecano y el ventilador Iron Man!!! Es su posibilidad de que usted podría enviarme la camiseta, por favor?
@kaneorobinson @russell_gilmore As a veteran I condone vests as a practical form of clothing. I side with the ridiculed on this one!!!
@johnliddell1982 Still nothing. Ill try again in a couple hours. Let them have their breakfast!!! #considerateLAD
The look on my face once I'd realised I'd left my phone at home!!! #falsealarm
@johnliddell1982 I've tried pandering to them, even in Spanish. I look forward to no reply!!!
@rvmoficial Hola, soy un Rayo Vallecano y el ventilador Iron Man. Es su posibilidad de que usted podría enviarme la camiseta, por favor?
@RVMOficial Hey, I'm a Rayo Vallecano and Iron Man fan from England. Is their any chance you could send me tonight's jersey please?
@johnliddell1982 Its even better since its in Spanish. Might tweet all the players and see if they can send me it!!!
@johnliddell1982 Send me the link and its on!!!
@Whoispol Surround sound makes it even worse. The feeling of Necromorphs all around you is terrifying!!!
@OutSideTheArea Not bad at all. Just wish his contributions in a match weren't so few and far between!!!
If it wasn't for Martinez I would despise Wigan as a club. Shit club, shit fans!!! #NUFC
Cisse needs to sort himself out like. He may have scored a couple recently but both were put on a plate. He adds nothing else!!! #NUFC
RT @TaylorR1984: In them few minutes after the tackle why can't the ref or the 4th official look at a video for 5 seconds and help the r ...
Disgusting challenge by McManaman but once again as the referee has seen it no further action will be taken. Let Carver at him!!! #NUFC
I will mostly be making this face at yet another wedding fair!!! #brokenman http://t.co/yTKd0JDDBY
Spent most of the morning listening to this to get me in the mood for viewing properties!!!  http://t.co/MM8FFTq6Mo
It may sound pessimistic but lose today and we are back in the battle to avoid relegation. Yesterday's results were not kind!!! #NUFC
@Russell_Gilmore Have fun in Wigan mate. I should be there and yet I'm at another wedding fair!!! #sadface
As much as we think its a conspiracy against us I reckon #SCFC have been last on #MOTD more than #NUFC!!!
@deanop69 You were awesome today mate. Couldn't handle you on the right!!!
Second victory of the weekend and another clean sheet. This time #TynemouthFC get the 5-0 victory!!!
@CANVisEffects Ok. Make it about 4pm as I finish work at 3pm. Go to nanas after?
@CANVisEffects Meet in town on Wednesday for dads gift since your not working?
@JoeBusby2707 I had the perfect view of you from where I was standing!!! #imanassman
@sullivancharlie @JoeBusby2707 @callmejonnyf @DaveyMc83 @aflewers @ita8dgr Felt like Neuer, looked like Big Bird. Ill take that!!!
Love a clean sheet me like. Fantastic performance from #NCLCUnited warranted the 4-0 score line!!!
@JoeBusby2707 @ita8dgr @sophiexcuthbert Beware of splinters sitting on the bench!!!
@alicelp48 Thanks Alice. Long way to go but stats like this make me happy. You hungover?
This gameplay better be don't let them shoot!!! @JoeBusby2707 @callmejonnyf @aflewers @jonscook @sullivancharlie @daveymc83
@JoeBusby2707 McMuffins it is then!!!
It's always nice seeing hard work pay off. Lost 9 lbs in 4 weeks!!! #operationslim
After one session with Coach Gray my reactions are now as fast as this man!!! #ehonda #NCLCUnited http://t.co/Ri93Ct1Eib
Woah, we're going to Benfica!!! #vengaboys #remix #NUFC
RT @Moroc_Mole: Aaaand... finished. Next. http://t.co/KeIYqLyl
@simjihoco Indeed, the role suits him perfectly. Wasted on the wing. Maybe you'll end up liking him with a few more of those performances!!!
@ibaz99 Indeed, the role suits him perfectly. Wasted out on the wing!!!
It's worth noting Gutierrez had a fantastic game standing in for Cabaye. Distribution and efforts in defence were first class!!! #NUFC
WOOOOOOOHOOOOOOO!!! #NUFC
Tiote is once again showing how much of a liability he is!!! #NUFC
Emmanuel Adebayor is footballs answer to Chris Gayle. Oozes talent but lacks urgency and commitment!!!
@Bri_Marsha Arteta?
Gutted to hear of the likely departure of @WesWelker to the #Broncos. No doubt @kaneorobinson will be happy with that signing!!! #Patriots
I'm hoping to be inducted into Team Rhodes Scholars with this beard!!! #WWE #yourewelcome
Tomas Rosicky is having a complete mare!!! #AFC #BMFC
The question on everyone's lips. Will Simon ever decide as to whether he wants another biscuit or not!!! #teachers
One of the best things about #RAW? I got two words for you, Brad Maddox!!! #WWE
@DaveyMc83 Awaiting volunteers to help with that!!!
@DaveyMc83 Extra defensive this weekend please Dave. Be my condom!!! #protectme
Looks like catching practice is in order since I'm between the sticks for #NCLCUnited this Saturday!!!
I can only dream that the day I build an #ironman suit it turns out to be this epic!!! #nochance http://t.co/HmveRYZuWI
@johnliddell1982 @peaza01 Better get practicing. Am I using standards Jacobs?
@johnliddell1982 This can only relate to Messi!!!
@johnliddell1982 @carternufc Me no remember this. My night is a jigsaw missing a canny few pieces!!!
@johnliddell1982 @carternufc Was this a quote to describe Chris?
@CANVisEffects Prima Donner has a Food Hygiene Rating of 3. Scumbag Dev!!!
@carternufc @btthompson86 @johnliddell1982 @rosslaurie86 @peaza01 Seeing Duff in that list will make me boo that little bit harder!!!
@CANVisEffects Is father home yet?
@DurhamCricket Thanks. Hope to make 2013 my first full season watching the Dynamos!!!
@DurhamCricket How much is your T20 season ticket this year?
@JoeBusby2707 @ita8dgr No more #stowbowlove for a while me thinks!!!
Who was responsible for convincing me to download this? @Peaza01 @johnliddell1982 @carternufc @rosslaurie86!!! http://t.co/DynAINSCYq
@ita8dgr Pissed and passionate!!!
@Mulhuzz Indeed I am mate!!!
@DaveyMc83 it takes 8 stowbow for me to speak the truth!!! #NCLCUnited
I am proud to be part of #NCLCUnited. The spirit and belief we have amongst us makes me proud of the men I defend, the people I protect!!!
“@johnliddell1982: @Peaza01 best party ever http://t.co/Ji1sCMhU1r” standard smut!!!
If i could be any type of wanker it would forever be a clean sheet wanker!!! #NCLCUnited
Silver lining being that I'm now watching #andrewlincoln in #Teachers. Fantastic comedy (series 1-3 only!!!)
I lasted 34 minutes when trying to watch #smackdown. Couldn't even last to the normal cut of point which is The Vault!!! #WWE
@lindseydavey I'm lying down in pain!!! #overindulged
Nothing says 'I've got a dentist appointment' quite like brushing your teeth in the work toilets!!!
Somebody mentioned Ruislip. I instantly think of Tim in Ruislip. I wonder if he still has his thumb and forefinger!!! #malcolmtucker
@CANVisEffects Yes. Finish work at 8pm. What time you going across? We are paying halves for mothers takeaway btw!!!
@JoeH1985 No doubt the warrior behind the account always got picked last when playing sport!!! #talentless
@CANVisEffects Bring my £30 please with you tomorrow!!!
@Peaza01 @johnliddell1982 @rosslaurie86 @carternufc There space for Caroline in the car mate?
@rosslaurie86 Expanding her product and there may be a batch on the horizon!!!
@rosslaurie86 Do you still love my nanas toffee cakes!!!
@Peaza01 @johnliddell1982 @carternufc @rosslaurie86 Ill speak to Caroline but I think about 3-4 we will be ready for!!!
@Peaza01 @johnliddell1982 @carternufc @rosslaurie86 Muscling in on this I'm in the loop. What time is party time?
@johnliddell1982 Possibly around 4pm. What time is the party getting started like?
It's so frustrating when all you see re: sporting jobs in North East is Personal Training!!!
For some reason I can't fall in love with the new suit. The extremis element is an outstanding concept but the colour bothers me!! #ironman3
@HorneyMedia Cricket is where it's at. A slight utter of unruly behaviour and you can wave goodbye to the match fee!!!
@MaTTmOOre1992 Regardless of where he hit Arbeloa if the latter didn't jumped it could have been far worse!!!
@MaTTmOOre1992 It doesn't matter, he planted studs into his chest. It's deemed dangerous play, by law he should have been sent off!!!
Totally agree with Roy Keane and its refreshing to see a pundit being controversially honest!!!
@kaneorobinson It may have been rescinded but Carlton Coles red card was deemed as dangerous play during the match!!! #consistent
What an amazing decision by the referee!!! #hongkongnani
Tonight's prediction is 2-2 with Ronaldo not to score!!! #RealMadrid #MUFC
@johnliddell1982 Glad you've got your priorities in order!!!
Put the Viagra down. If you need an erection, watch the #ironman3 trailer!!! http://t.co/JCIBEx6bva
@CANVisEffects Ill be going to football for 9:15 so it would have to be around then!!!
@CANVisEffects Also going to Tynemouth has been postponed. I've got no money but still come round and we can get an Indians or something!!!
@CANVisEffects Are we clubbing together for fathers gifts? I was thinking Scottish Rugby top and nice bottle of whisky from Fenwicks etc!!!
@JoeBusby2707 With only 18 goals conceded in 14 games, we don't need @gnev2!!! #complacent
New trailer in 1 day. I'm determined to resist but I know I'm going to give in like the #ironman slut I am!!! #ironman3
I wonder if @missnufc would like Game of Thrones Season 2 for Mother's Day!!! #scumbagson
Just watched the infamous fight between Dyer and Bowyer. Such a surreal moment. Hope Shearer battered both of them!!! #NUFC
@BlondieRodge Not even close. Although that pic was him remembering he was watching The Avengers that evening!!!
@BlondieRodge Its makes me fist pump more than 'Tiger' Tim Henman!!!

Thanks to @Jon_Favreau every time I listen to #ACDC I fantasise about #ironman. For the record, that ain't a bad thing!!!
I'm seriously considering turning #ElClasico off for Pinto's hair alone!!!
@Bafangul Had me hooked from the moment Wilson was introduced to a tea spoon!!!
@Bafangul Its all done although its looking favourable for a second series. Something Alan Partridge didn't get!!!
Not a wink of sleep so far. Wish this illness would disappear right about now!!! #poorly
I am 3-0 this season when watching #NUFC at #SJP. Someone buy me a season ticket!!! #goodluckcharm
Good luck to @DaleSteyn62 tonight at the Oscars. Lets hope he and #Skyfall win an award for their cinematic efforts!!! #lookalike
Do you want to play at SJP on May 26th? Pay £96 to play or £5 to enter the raffle ticket to win a place. Comment if you're interested! #NUFC
The bloke behind me kept shouting at some kid called Cissoko!!! #NUFC

@CANVisEffects Caroline's. Hopefully be there about 12:30!!!
@CANVisEffects Dad says to give me £5 and he will reimburse you when he's back from Bedlington!!!
@JonFleming86 @CANVisEffects Ended up buying both!!!
@JoeBusby2707 That aside they give it their all when they put on an England jersey!!!
Watching England play Rugby is a much more rewarding experience than watching the Prima Donnas who represent football!!!
@CANVisEffects Dead Space artwork or Hyrule Historia!!!
Dead Space artwork or Hyrule Historia. Help @JonFleming86!!! #nerdproblems
@DaveyMc83 You're a man with impeccable taste!!!
@ita8dgr Ahhh no more spoilers. Still haven't seen it!!!!
Now I know how The Governor feels after being left with a bloody nose whilst playing #thewalkingdead!!! #cutopen
I am literally lost for something to do as football has been postponed due to this unwelcome snow!!! #NCLCUnited

General Melchett (@stephenfry) for me has to be one of the best characters in the history of British comedy!!! #speckledjim

@GMMJohnson Hey, was just wondering if you wanted to play football at St James' Park in May? It's £96 for the full experience!!!
The new #WWE Championship belt is awesome like. Some guy did good!!!
Playing Dead Space 3 before bed time isn't one of my greatest decisions!!! #shakingwithfear
@atoward Welcome to the Pats Nation. No doubt your love for @Edelman11 and Wes Welker will blossom like mine did!!!
Thank you @vodafoneUK for failing to disclose that you get charged if you send a long text!!! #ridiculous
Caught up on #EliminationChamber and once again suffering from mixed emotions. Another @CMPunk loss but Swagger is going to #Wrestlemania!!!

Best moment of my life. Yohan Cabaye has just displayed his gratitude to me for being a courteous driver!!!
@JoeBusby2707 I let him through my lane of traffic into the training facility. I'm sure he winked at me as well as waving!!!
What a goal!!! #thfc
@JoeBusby2707 You're a good one!!!
@JoeBusby2707 Don't just be hogging my tweet, share it with the world!!! #desperateplea

@PFBarberAndShop Do you maintain out of control beards?
@Russell_Gilmore @kaneorobinson @robynsimpson Since we're big fans of marvel movies how about we meet up on April 26th for Iron Man 3!!!
Listening to the #gameofthrones soundtrack whilst running in the snow made me feel I was north of the wall!!!
For the first time since high school I'm suffering from wankers cramp!!! #notwhatyouthink
@kaneorobinson It'll just be our team split into two. Captain Nichols Vs Captain Harrison!!!
@MrDeanHarrison Ill take a completely staged penalty at the end of 60 minutes. Just like Shearer Vs. Celtic in his testimonial!!!
@deanop69 Just got an email from Dean. He will be sending the details out soon. Can't wait!!!
@kaneorobinson The club normally rent out the pitch post season before it gets a makeover. My mate booked it and I'm in!!!
Got a free space in your diary? Come and watch myself and #TynemouthFC play at St. James' Park, 4pm Sunday May 26th!!! #NUFC
@MrDeanHarrison OMG really. Send me the details mate!!!

@johnliddell1982 Of course mate, glad to hear you can join the 30 strong lads crossing the border!!!
@johnliddell1982 People said it was too far to travel for a weekend since there was no flights!!!
I'm so relieved to have finally settled on a location for my Stag Weekend!!! #Glasgow
First training session for #TynemouthFC and it was hard work in the Arctic weather. Commitment and effort shown by all the boys!!! #TFC
If a manager says his team have 'insert number' cup finals they should be fined by the F.A!!!
@kaneorobinson I'm out as well. Think ill have to sneak away for a hour and check out my redneck brothers!!!
Why am I only just getting into Dawson's Creek?
@kaneorobinson @cristiano Refer to my previous tweet!!!
Those who claim Bale is better than Ronaldo. Enjoy the egg on your face!!!
Niall Quinn is a biased bellend!!! #NUFC
I hate how easily influenced I am!!!
@CallingSpots Remind me closer to the time as this interests me!!!
Really enjoyed the #EngvAus women's cricket match this morning. Found myself overcome with nerves towards the end!!! @ECB_cricket
@kaneorobinson Let's hope @_xXcarolineXx_ sees it that way!!! #bridezilla
Not exactly the wisest purchase when I've a wedding and stag to organise as well as searching for a new job!!! http://t.co/lQBTzIMA
My face tastes like a Gammon Steak!!! #salty #GNR13
It appears I have memorised the words to the #ironman3 trailer with the voices and actions!!! #wellworthit
@NifferMonster They just mope about, constantly on their period and piss in the tumble dryer. Or is that just the cat I live with?
The thing I hate most about #instagram is #catsofinstagram. Cats are not cute, they're evil and boring!!!
@DaveyMc83 Not a problem mate. I understand. Thanks for letting me know!!!
@JonFleming86 Not a problem mate. I understand. Thanks for letting me know!!!
@DaveyMc83 Hey mate. I sent you an invite on FB and I just need a yes or no for now as I need numbers for hotels for my stag!!!
@JonFleming86 Hey mate. I sent you an invite on FB and I just need a yes or no for now as I need numbers for hotels for my stag!!!
@team_penaluna Cheers. I just need a yes or no basically as I need numbers for hotels for my stag!!!
@team_penaluna Hey mate, did you get my text?
I'm so proud of myself. I managed to resist a doorstop slice of homemade Victoria Sponge Cake!!!
Travelodge is my saviour!!!
GNR13 training started today and 2.5 mile in the bank has put me in a good mood. Even slipping over on the ice couldn't stop me!!!
RT @TheReal_SMoore: @dannysimpson Should have just backed off like you normally do
Now that the @NFL has came to its conclusion I can turn my attention to @DurhamCricket. Lets hope they fair better than the @Patriots!!!
@NifferMonster I've just thought, why don't you play American Football, become MVP every season and go to Disneyland for free!!!
Couldn't watch Ray Lewis looking as happy as someone found not guilty of murder. No doubt there was tears and praise for Jesus!!! #SB47
Meh!!! #Superbowl47
About time the #49ers pulled their finger out. Lets make sure Ray Lewis isn't crying tears of joy come full time!!! #Superbowl47
I always love watching people being taken out on the sideline!!! #Superbowl47
@DavidOtunga Fantastic performance from your other half. Who are you rooting for?
Not ashamed to admit I shall be soaking my battered feet whilst watching the #superbowl. Going for a #49ers victory!!!
My dummy may be across the room since the Patriots lost, but I can't wait for #SuperBowl #XLVII. Lets go #49ers!!! #NFL
To the guy who thinks he's a big shot handing over a £20 note in a Wetherspoons. You are in fact a massive knob!!! #Durham
@Bri_Marsha Examples?
If there's one thing I hate on a night out and that's being a river bank!!!
So far I've found (stalked) £2.50 on the floor!!! #frugle
@Bafangul Ha great minds!!! #didnotplageriseyourtweet
I would give anything to be reading 'The Pink' tonight after that result!!! #NUFC
@Bafangul The magnitude of the result determines the amount of papers purchased the following morning. Might even attempt the broadsheets!!!
No matter how many times #ESPNGoals force me to watch the 'Bullet to the Head' trailer, id rather take said bullet than watch the movie!!!
The adrenaline pumping through my veins is a feeling you can only get watching #NUFC. What a result!!!
@Russell_Gilmore @kaneorobinson What's up guys? I've been playing football!!!
@PFBarberAndShop Indeed, a lesson learned certainly. I look forward to maybe getting my head in that frame of yours!!!
It appears a butchers and a barbers are one in the same at Low Fell. Knew I should have went to @PFBarberAndShop!!!
As captain of Tynemouth F.C I'd like to share our new club badge. Come support us during the 2013/2014 season!!! #RT http://t.co/RIJdkSZ3
@MaTTmOOre1992 http://t.co/heMGqoaE
Watching the Stoke fans reinforces my hatred for their club. The nippleLAD in the background is a complete knob!!! #DeadlineDay
Even though Danny Graham will be playing for #SAFC he will spend 85% of his time living, shopping and partying in Newcastle!!! #NUFC
@carternufc He should mix it up every #DeadlineDay. Arriving on a tricycle in the summer and a pogo stick next year!!!
@NUFCOfficial Buy Danny Graham and ill take your unsold stock of Strawberry Syrup!!!
I hope we offer to pay clubs £5million to take @NilePowerRanger from us!!!
@nufcfans I hope we offer to pay clubs £5million to take @NilePowerRanger from us!!!
My childhood favourite in Wacky Races was The Slag Brothers. Today I found out they finished 5th in the overall standings!!! #europaleague
@carternufc Thank you so much for sharing this with me!!!
@PFBarberAndShop How much do you charge for a gentleman haircut?
@official_rjk It's a top that I needs to order!!!
Finally leaving behind the tiny gym at work in favor of #TheGym at Newcastle East. No more 15 minute max workouts on the treadmill!!!
@official_rjk Its ridiculous like. I reckon when he closed the door he made Punk beat The Rock with his action figures!!!
All but one can be proud of their efforts today. The exception, Guitirrez. I dont normally single players out but he was poor!!!  #NUFC
@JoeBusby2707 Ha, with our inflated egos we should be able to win everything in the air!!!
Say what you want about the second half but that was an awesome defensive display. May have gave it away but we contained them well!! #NUFC
Thanks to @YCabayeofficiel my voice is starting to go!!! #NUFC
I have just woke up the street with that strike!!! #dream #manlove #sorethroat #NUFC
Amazing start by #NUFC and a fantastic finish to boot!!!
@BlondieRodge http://t.co/mUJPdOYF This should work!!!
For the second time in a row, the day I leave my bike at work I come back to a flat tyre. I swear someone is doing it!!!
@nufcfans Wouldn't that be the case if he moved to #NUFC?

Time to start the countdown. 89 DAYS!!! #ironman3
@Russell_Gilmore @_xxcarolinexx_ @kaneorobinson @robynsimpson Nice, ill speak to Caroline and see if she can make it!!!
@M_A_Dean I reckon we could snap him for 4 million and to play for his boyhood team he won't be wanting a crazy wage unlike some others!!!
I'm being greedy like but Pardew, buy Danny Graham!!! #NUFC
@JoeBusby2707 My reaction was paltry in comparison. I simply stripped to my underwear and beat my chest!!!
@robynsimpson @kaneorobinson @russell_gilmore @_xxcarolinexx_ How about a trip to Tynemouth, go to the traditional market and then more!!!
@robynsimpson @kaneorobinson @russell_gilmore @_xxcarolinexx_ Hey, I'm afraid I'm fully booked until the Sunday. What did up have in mind!!!
@NifferMonster Think ill take a Nokia 3310 next time I go!!!
@NifferMonster Sort out my signal then!!!
Centre Parks and a night out to Nottingham for the stag? #decisions
Everything I hoped for in this #RoyalRumble didn't come to pass. A massage for two of the biggest egos in #WWE!!!
@official_rjk The Rock has come back to looooose!!!
@johnliddell1982 I hope for you, Rock wins. I hope for everyone else the #bestintheworld retains!!!
@Cm2795 I'd rather they copied 1995 than 2012 #RockvsCena!!!
@johnliddell1982 How much did you invest in your faith?
Cena? Now I know how Jehovah witnesses feel at Christmas!!! #nothing #WWE #RoyalRumble
@Russell_Gilmore I'm so disappointed at the result who ever wins now. You need to find a love for @HEELZiggler or @CodyRhodesWWE!!!
What a disgusting final 3 in the #RoyalRumble. Simply disgusting!!! #WWE
I want a refund if Ryback wins the #RoyalRumble!!! #WWE
@Russell_Gilmore You picked a good night like. Who'd you like the look of in 2013?
I do love it when you see a #WWE wriggle on the ropes!!! #RoyalRumble
@Russell_Gilmore Its real mate, keep watching it throughout the year. Didn't take me long to get back into it!!!
The 200/1 @DavidOtunga bet isn't looking so wasteful anymore!!!
Fuck right off!!! #RoyalRumble #WWE #TeamRhodesScholars
@johnliddell1982 Who you got your money on like!!!
@johnliddell1982 Hoping 200/1 Otunga but realistically thinking Orton!!!
@johnliddell1982 I'm thinking Kane or Bryan screws one another for a singles feud!!!
This is why I'm here!!! #teamrhodesscholars
The next #WWE fitness DVD 'Crunches with Big Show!!! #WWE #RoyalRumble
@M_A_Dean I know, needs to get the cover on a knackered Del Rio!!!
Please cash in @HEELZiggler. Make my night!!! #RoyalRumble
@lindseydavey Do you mean Shamus? Either way #bestmamintheworld for letting him stay up!!!
Cheeky £1 on Orton to win the #RoyalRumble although I'm hoping for a @DavidOtunga victory!!! #WWE
Time for a nap before the #RoyalRumble. Hoping for a title change for @CodyRhodesWWE and @HEELZiggler cashing in!!! #WWE
I'm not being racist but a black wedding dress? Just doesn't look right!!!

@petemck86 Hazard should have gave him the 5 knuckle shuffle!!!
@official_rjk Basically he was being a bellend, lying over the ball so Hazard couldn't retrieve it so kicked the ball/the kid!!!
My thoughts are with the parents of the injured. I hope #hazard does the right thing and visits him in hospital!!! #PrayForBallBoy

Never been one to suffer on #bluemonday but #NUFC and the #Patriots have inflicted said mood on me this year!!!
@CANVisEffects Brilliant!!!
Well my apprehension before the game has been justified. Congrats to the #Ravens, deserved winners. #Patriots simply didn't turn up today!!!
Staying up late and with nothing to show for it will make tomorrow feel a whole lot longer!!! #Patriots
@MaTTmOOre1992 Just don't!!!
Passing game out of sorts as well as the offence in general for the #Patriots. Starting to worry now!!!
@neilreynoldsnfl Do you think there will ever be a day when a 'Champions League' comes into fruition to help improve worldwide football!!!
@SkySportsNFL Do you think there will ever be a day when a 'Champions League' comes into fruition to help improve worldwide football!!!
Its going to be a tight game but unfortunately I can see the #Ravens edging this one with a pumped up defence led by Ray Lewis!!!
Lets force out way through this @Ravens defence and get to Superbowl XLVII!!! #Patriots
@ita8dgr Deffo I was looking to go west if we stayed in the UK like!!!
@JonFleming86 Reviews have been hit and miss but as you're into your Sci-Fi you won't be disappointed!!!

Why are flights so fucking expensive!!!
I wonder whether #MUFC enjoy the taste of their own medicine!!!
@JonFleming86 Exactly mate but deffo watch it. Surprised you haven't already!!!
@JonFleming86 First 4 seasons are fantastic mate. The latest has been a major letdown!!! #IMO

One of the games of the season. The sheer determination shown by the #Ravens (plus an interception from Manning) got them home!!! #Broncos

@kaneorobinson Nah mate #Ravens got this!!!

@robynsimpson Good value. If she enjoys a beer you can find them for €1.50. Cocktails are cheap too if she'd prefer that!!!
@robynsimpson I loved it yeah. It rained quite a bit but that was probably the time of year. The broadwalk was full of bars, restaurants!!!
@robynsimpson You are indeed. Are you and Kane thinking of going like?
@robynsimpson @kaneorobinson No worries. We can just have an academic blowout since you and Sarah will be done for the summer!!!

@JoeBusby2707 The release clause in my contract was activated when I was offered the role of dressing room D.J!!! #newdeal?

I blew my top with Marveaux tonight. The amount of times he lost it and didn't bust a gut to win it back. Midfield protects defence!!! #NUFC
Ball ball ball ball ball ball. That's what Bigirimana touched!!! #NUFC

What on earth was I thinking, trying on a medium in topman? The size didn't even fit when I was a medium!!!

@racheljane_xo Between £7.99 - £10.99. It's worth it since the show and graphic novels differ somewhat!!!
@racheljane_xo Forbidden Planet in town and Amazon are the best places. The latter being quite cheaper!!!
@racheljane_xo Can't believe you haven't already. They're awesome like although Rick Grimes isn't as hunky!!!
@kaneorobinson I'm surprised this reply had a tag then!!!
@kaneorobinson Was this meant for me!!!
@CallingSpots @carl_rich At least the garlic smell that would've filtered through John and @finey5286 room would have been an improvement!!!
@CallingSpots Thanks for not going all Season 3 Rick Grimes on me!!! #gonenuts
@CallingSpots Deserved it but also enjoyed it. When I chased you around the hotel room it was simply to give you a hug to say thank you!!!
Almost made a fatal error during #tinoswinterwarmer. Forgot which was which in terms of a garlic clove and bulb!!! #potentialoverdose

Great to see @CodyRhodesWWE back, a real life Wolverine. If it wasn't for Team Rhodes Scholars this elimination match would've been skipped!
I would quite like to see Santon left wing and Jonas left back as the former is much more of an attacking threat with pace!!! #NUFC

@stevewraith ... Could you possibly follow me so I can DM you a more in depth description, that is if you'd be interested in helping. Thanks
@stevewraith as someone who could potentially get in touch with them. It's a genuine idea ATM and Robbie Elliott has stated he would play...
@stevewraith Hi Steve, I'm looking to set up a charity football match with ex #NUFC players. A couple of people have mentioned your name ...
@robbieelliott3 That's brilliant. Thanks for the reply. Ill get back to you with a date but can't imagine it'll be before May/ June 2013!!!
@robbieelliott3 Would you be interested at all in playing?
@robbieelliott3 I might be a bit ambitious but I was hoping to get together some ex #NUFC players to play against our team...
@robbieelliott3 I hope to arrange a football match to raise money for @SBRFoundation and my local football team...
@robbieelliott3 Just want to first of all say I admire your fantastic dedication and efforts which I hope to emulate in the future...
The hardest thing to take about last night is the fact that Cameron Jerome scored!!! #onceinabluemoon #NUFC
@UndisputedVE To save you from asking the inevitable question, how about we get each other a new @DavidOtunga coffee flask!!! #slurp #xmas
It's hard to take but at least #NUFC put in a (80 minute) performance that brings a glimmer of hope that we can turn it around!!!
Is anyone's twitter feed showing tweets from May 2012? They're saying Cisse has scored!!! #NUFC
Whenever I see a singular Magpie I frantically search for a second!!! #twoforjoy

@Bri_Marsha I find you even more sexy now that you have a scar!!! #badboy
Cue immense panic after walking face first through a spiders web!!!
I support everyone taking part in #Movember, especially those with a pre pubescent tash. Although I can only donate what I can afford!!!
@UndisputedVE Why didn't you give mother Halo for me!!!
@ita8dgr @atoward Ha why were these in the paper? I think @shieldsgazette have been looking at our FB photos for Halloween inspiration!!!
RT @AnthonyShaw_: Obama right now.. #USElection http://t.co/BCu45q5L
@NifferMonster Really? Maybe ill watch through the gap in the stadium then!!!
@NifferMonster Put them both together and it would have made for a fantastic debate!!!
Whenever #NUFC are playing away I'm going to watch @Gatesheadfc at the International Stadium. Who's with me?
By the sounds of it #MCFC could use @JoeBusby2707 and myself at centre back!!! #rocksolid
Can someone at #Marvel buy the rights from 20th Century Fox for Wolverine and make 'Old Man Logan!!!'
@ita8dgr My hamstrings are battered mate. I blame your lunges!!!
To get in the mood for 5th November celebrations I shall be watching V for Vendetta!!!
@kaylzj88 If there's an alien invasion ill be all right!!! #protection
@Jonny85geordie Indeed. I can assure you he didn't do much rowing until he spotted the ladies by the lakeside!!!
@kaylzj88 From what I remember I had a great time head banging and spilling my pint everywhere. I blame your death juice!!!
@OragamiShark Thanks very much. Was breaking apart throughout the night but it was worth it!!!
@UndisputedVE I'm the World Heavy Weight Champion!!!
@carternufc I can't watch the BET365 adverts anymore after you said what ever the selection is it comes true!!!
YES!!! YES!!! YES!!! #Cabaye
I really can't wait till my mid afternoon snooze!!!
Such a good weekend has made this hangover totally worth it. Halloween costume went down a treat!!! http://t.co/KPlEhscg
I love pretending I'm a #Jedi when I approach automatic doors!!!
My awesome weekend continues with a fancy dress party with @atoward and @kaylzj88. Lets hope 5 weeks of preparation is worth it!!!
@ita8dgr Is footy still on this morning?
The #MILF in front was seriously gushing for @CodyRhodesWWE like. I don't blame her like, he's bloody awesome!!! #WWENewcastle #WWE
Hearing 'I'm here to show the world' before watching @HEELZiggler steal the show made my night!!! #WWE #WWENewcastle
@alicelp48 To suck in the gut!!!
I feel like #beyonce in my sucky in knickers!!! #bootylicious
@NifferMonster Not forgetting the hatred. Always makes it matter more!!!
Lets hope for a decent roster tonight at the #WWE Raw World Tour. Please no Heath Slater or the Prime Time Players!!!
@UndisputedVE If there ain't any for £20 few jars in town? I finish at 4pm!!!
@UndisputedVE Are you still wanting to go to the Wrestling?
@carternufc Straight from the archive. Look alright there. My receding hairline and bald spot doesn't combine with a hairless face!!!
@carternufc The general opinion is that It's taken years off me. Tom Selleck by the end of the month like!!!
My first full shave in about 8 years in aid of #movember!!! http://t.co/4b5dc07g
Do not be fooled by the many imitations of @EmmettScanlan this #movember. Although I understand their desire to be him!!!
@Russell_Gilmore Also Bronson is filled with scenes of Tom Hardy's piece. Maybe that will sway your decision one way or the other!!!
@Russell_Gilmore TBH you should watch none of them. Its Halloween and its essential to be scared witless!!!
@Russell_Gilmore @TheRock Silly boy, you have Inception there. Insert and enjoy!!!
@Patriots Might dress as a slaughtered ram since that's what you did to them Sunday!!!
It turns out my puncture was caused not by a nail, glass or another sharp implement but by a bit of wood!!! #shittyres
Happy Halloween everyone. I look forward to Alan Robson's Night owls tonight. That is until I get too scared to listen!!!
When Daniel Craig retires I do hope Tom Hardy replaces him!!! #jamesbond
@NifferMonster Simon Skinner!!! #herecomesthefuzz
Turns out that #Skyfall was a delight to behold. The only thing it lacked was Timothy Dalton!!!
I've just paid £1.49 for a 450g mix up from Wilkinsons. When bought at the cinema it would have cost me £5.60. Be ashamed #Empire!!!
I take pleasure in popping @_xXcarolineXx_ bond cherry tonight. She will then be made to watch the greatest bond ever, Goldeneye!!!
I take pleasure if popping @_xXcarolineXx_ bond cherry tonight. She will then be made to watch the greatest bond ever, Goldeneye!!!
It seems my mother is a bigger fan of Dolph Ziggler than me. Styling her hair like him and everything!!! http://t.co/GippJDEI
@ita8dgr You'll find no tears in there only blood, sweat and few toe nails!!!
Feels good to get back on the pitch after last weekends postponed game. Although, when will I learn to not slide on AstroTurf!!! #blood
@JoeBusby2707 Cheers mate. See you tonight!!!
@Bri_Marsha How's the patient? Will you be in long enough for me to visit with grapes and NUTS magazine!!!
@joebusby2707 Hey mate. Do you mind if I come along tonight for football?
@ita8dgr Ill be there tonight mate, ready to kick around a regular football!!! #withdrawal
@ita8dgr When and where is football tonight?
Scumbag driver!!! #nationalexpress
@NifferMonster You don't deserve him if your eyes are wandering already!!! #sexysanton
Such an awesome experience watching the #Patriots destroy the #Rams. The score being a true reflection on the game!!! #patsinlondon
Time for a Home Alone rush to Wembley Stadium!!! #Patriots
@nationalexpress Due to this bus breaking down (ref code YD 8) I may miss the NFL match. If so I expect compensation!!!
National Express taking the piss!!!
@M_A_Dean Are you going like?
@M_A_Dean Going to the NFL at Wembley. Lets go Patriots!!!
The new driver is retarded. Managed to lose his log in pass and has now managed to break the disabled access ramp. Going nowhere fast!!!
I've already exhausted all my supplies and I'm only 3 hours into this bus trip!!! #starving
Today I face an impossible task in making my iPhone battery last 24 hours!!! #missionimpossible
@callmejonnyf @timbo_carr @callmeamyf Hopefully create a masterpiece for the fridge!!!
@Timbo_Carr It seems I'm in for a treat!!!
@Timbo_Carr @callmejonnyf @callmeamyf Thanks anyway guys. I might have to entertain myself with something called a book!!!
So gutted that today's cancellation means no #NCLCUnited action for 3 weeks!!!
I managed to sleep through my alarm but thankfully the noise of my mother snoring in the next room woke me!!!
Normally I'm the first to make yellow snow but this time I hope it melts in time for tomorrow's match!!!
I wanna be part of the Ricktatorship!!! #TheWalkingDead
@Peaza01 Damn, missed it. What channel is it on?
@Bafangul I'd have ran back into my ward and locked the door. Sandwich for strength and penicillin for the odd infection!!!
@BlondieRodge Hands off, he and his handle bar task are mine!!!
@rosslaurie86 @carternufc It didn't help with it being roastin' after leaving in it the sun. We were wise to stick with DVC!!!
@UndisputedVE Bring with you on Sunday any games you have for the DS that aren't 3D!!!
@kaneorobinson The guy is so photogenic. Always knows where the camera is!!!
If this isn't the best picture of Alan Pardew show me otherwise!!! #NUFC http://t.co/NZzqlqS7
As much as it pains me to say, I was so disappointed with the Fringe season 5 premier!!!
Does anyone else think Fonzie resembles an Obertan with hair!!! #NUFC
Many positives to come out of tonight not least Bigi, Santon and Sammy. A concern though in Tiote and the M.I.A Cisse!!! #NUFC
Anyone want to play Chris Waddle bingo? When ever he mentions the 'final third' down your drink!!! #smashed #nufc
If it wasn't for @YCabayeofficiel being so fantastic my favourite #NUFC player would have to be Bigi. Amazing promise for the future!!!
One half of the dynamic duo finally entertained me somewhat. They fell asleep with their finger pressing down on the keys spelling zzzz!!!
#ilovemypartnerwhen she tries to stop herself from laughing at the shows she claims to hate!!! @_xXcarolineXx_
Looking forward to today's shift with the dynamic duo!!! #sarcasm
@ita8dgr Its the legs. Those loooooong legs!!!
@BBDatabase First day back at the gym tomorrow so its an apple turnover!!!
@kaneorobinson Its true mate. I never thought I'd think otherwise but her reign is over!!! #athleticsbabes
I think @LauraTrott31 has now surpassed Jessica Ennis as THE pin up athlete!!!
Ever since the introduction of Team Rhodes Scholars I have a renewed interest in the tag team championships!!! #WWE #yourewelcome
A lesson learnt today. Always check the seat for piss before you sit down!!! #wetbum
@peeetweet Go wild then ha. I'm going as Samus Aran. The female bounty hunter from Metroid. It's been a total bugger to make like!!!
@peeetweet Awesome, good luck returning them to her without blood, face paint and alcohol on them!!! #impossibletask
@peeetweet What did you decide to go as? I can't wait to dress up like!!!
Walked into the house to be greeted by a bowl of melted chocolate!!! #result #lickedspoon
Someone please tell Denise Robertson Halloween is next week. Although I am impressed with her makeup team!!! #zombie
Click this link, you won't regret it!!! http://t.co/3vrdYsxw #ironman3
It's all a bit Silent Hill out there!!!
As a kid my variety pack would last 8 days. These days I eat 4 packs at a time!!! #fatlad
@kaneorobinson I won't tell you again, hands off!!!
Anyone I'm the mood for a #Xisco tonight!!! #NUFC
My new background on the iPhone. Sorry @_xXcarolineXx_ for being relegated!!! #MILF #TheWalkingDead http://t.co/P3eCv1k4
@JoeBusby2707 Sounds like your a bit of a #NFL slut!!! #wanderingeyes
@JoeBusby2707 Who's your team? Don't say the #Giants otherwise we can't be friends anymore!!!
@ita8dgr @joebusby2707 If I'd known you were a fan I'd have have offered you my brothers ticket. Unfortunately he's got someone lined up!!!
@JoeBusby2707 Yeah pal. Cant wait to see the #Patriots throw that pigskin into the End Zone; and the 14 hour bus trip!!!
Its just occurred to me that I may be in the #Rams section of the Wembley crowd. Must be on my best behaviour after a #Patriots TD!!!
Fantastic result last night for the #Patriots. Overtime winner gives us the momentum for Wembley this Sunday!!!
Only 24 hours until the official trailer of #ironman3 is released!!!
I just a mess!!! #dreamboat
This is one of my favourite images of #derbyday!!! #NUFC http://t.co/QTRZH40T
Pardew has Shola locked in a room, forcing him to watch images of cheesy chips, pennywell and the unwashed!!! #NUFC #DerbyDay
McDonalds breakfast, bets placed, cans bought and listened to a chorus of 'Dirty Mackem'. Bring it on!!! #NUFC
@rosslaurie86 If Carlsberg did reassuring talks!!! #calm
@rosslaurie86 It's so stressful mate!!!
I really do hate derby day!!! #NUFC #stressed
@rosslaurie86 http://t.co/i9eNX3cQ
@rosslaurie86 Will do mate. The leaving party is heading to Gotham!!!
@carternufc @finey5286 Love a good egg like. Specially when it's @mrchimmychenga
@Peaza01 I am honoured to be part of your 2nd and 3rd tweet despite being one of your #plasticpals!!!
@Peaza01 :( #paranoidmarty
