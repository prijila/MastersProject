@bruuhisnotdead :-) está tenso para o Rick, ele sumiu dentro do bloco matando todo os Walkers sozinho.
Michone is really badass. #TheWalkingDaughter
@bruuhisnotdead pois é, mas acho que esse não será tão tenso quanto semana passada.
Not sure why so much focus on Rick. I am interested to see what Carl wil become #TheWalkingDaughter #TheWalkingDead

@DJMN_ tem problema não pq eu sempre sei qual será o final antes da metade do filme.
@DJMN_ não revelei nada, com exceção que o T-Dog foi mordido.
@DJMN_ spoiler não, já passou.
@bruuhisnotdead pois é, acabou aí. E o spoiler do próximo episódio mostrou que será tenso.
@bruuhisnotdead mas de qq forma meteu bala nela.
@bruuhisnotdead a Mãe não tinha mais jeito. E o Rick ficará louco.
@bruuhisnotdead tenso.  O Carl vai virar um psicopata.
@bruuhisnotdead Carl has step up. I am afraid of that kid and so should be the Governor. #LoriInLabor #TheWalkingDead
@bruuhisnotdead o episódio foi tenso demais.
@bruuhisnotdead o Rick tá matando os zumbis que invadiram a cadeia.
@bruuhisnotdead o personagem mais pesado de todos será o Carl.  Tá sangue nos olhos.
@bruuhisnotdead mas eles não tem como salva-lá.
@bruuhisnotdead Não. A Carol está longe da Lori. E o bebe tá nascendo de cesaria com a Maggie e o Carl fazendo o parto.
Lori can't die, come on! #TheWalkingDead #LoriInLabor
It could only have been the guy that Rick left escape #LoriInLabor #TheWalkingDead
@bruuhisnotdead quem parece do Mal é o Governador.
@bruuhisnotdead e o T-Dog acabou a salvando nos momentos finais. A Carol abriu uma Walker para ver os órgãos, ela tá ficando melhor.
#TheWalkingDead is all happening at the same time. #LoriInLabor seems like an action movie.
Will the baby be dead or alive? #LoriInLabor #TheWalkingDead
@bruuhisnotdead o T-Dog já era. Morderam em um lugar sem salvação.
I bet by the end of the episode #LoriInLabor the innmates will have proven valuable. #TheWalkingDead
T-Dog bitten, #Loriinlabor without Ricky or Hershell around? Will Carl step it up?
T-dog disagrees with Ricky and get bitten.  Come on! You did better #TheWalkingDead

@allouh Depending what you are using for. Inspiron for Home, Vostro for Small Business and Latitude for Large Enterprise/Government

@henriqueuhlmann Vostro tem outras dif em spec e opcionais: veja a placa de rede, leitor de impressões digitais, teclado iluminado
@henriqueuhlmann o Inspiron tem mais opções de cores. O Vostro tem dimensões menores que o Inspiron. A bateria do Vostro deve durar um mais.
@henriqueuhlmann Eu ficaria com Vostro porque sou responsável pelo planejamento deles :-) Falando sério, o Vostro tem mais opçõe de garantia
@henriqueuhlmann acho que não irá se arrepender. Depois q vc finalizar a sua opção, adoraria saber o q vc achou do produto.
@henriqueuhlmann O Vostro V130 tem opção de DVD externo via USB ou eSATA. O Vostro V130 tem melhor desempenho que o Vostro V13.
@sreedhar23 yes, 300-500 but there are many factors such as room temperature, battery temperature, impact on the battery, and go on.
@henriqueuhlmann apenas testando mesmo para ver. Se vc passar o modelo do processador do Inspiron 15 q vc tem, eu posso ver como se comparam
@henriqueuhlmann olhei as specs do PromoB, talvez o Vostro v13 fique um pouco aquém do necessário em processamento e gráficos.
@sendai :-) thanks for promoting Dell Vostro
@henriqueuhlmann O design do Vostro V13 realmente é vencedor (ganhamos até prêmio da http://en.red-dot.org). Quais aplicativos vc usará?
@henriqueuhlmann Se vc precisar de performance de processamento e video para seus projetos, vá no Vostro 3300 ou 3500 pois tem + desempenho
@henriqueuhlmann O Vostro V130 tem i3 e i5 ULV em tela de 13-pol e 19.7mm de espessura, o Vostro 3500 tem i3, e i5 SV em tela de 15-pol.
@tiagodmeq Qual dos modelos de Dell Vostro que você gostou?
@sendai @catebolt @ferrous Dell Vostro is target to Small Business without IT staff focus on Value per Dollar, Data Security and Support
@jaeoh_shin Hard for me to tell as I projected Vostro V13, but I like that system. If you have any question let me know.
@sreedhar23 A battery last ~300 recharging cycles. It is an industry standard. Check http://bit.ly/grfwQu for tips on how to preserve it.
