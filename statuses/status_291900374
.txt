@AndyBell26 5 year deal, I'm happy with that. Hopefully will be given time

@AndyBell26 you lost ¬£20m on Carroll, that's the difference
@AndyBell26 Torres and Alonso. For spurs, Bale, Modric, Berbatov, Carrick etc. Liverpool abuse their foreign owners and spend recklessly..

@AndyBell26 no
Shambles
I feel sick
@Nibzza city at home though. They are likely to score, but let's hope Daws can keep a clean sheet on his 300th cap!
@Nibzza just excited
@Nibzza have no idea what to think
@Wizward looks like it, can't imagine paulinho playing too far forward, need him to help Sandro in defence as well as distribution
@AndyBell26 his heading can be poor and lead to mistakes but I'd be gutted to see him get replaced..which won't happen anytime soon anyway
@AndyBell26 from the back, one of our only positive players sometimes and can be depended on to start every game. His defence, especially (2
