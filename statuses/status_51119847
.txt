@HTurner15 I understand and mostly agree, especially taking the piss if it's things like colds and dandruff, but I think if you imagine
@HTurner15 yes, I agree. I think it's wrong on all scales but obviously this type of thing has the most impact
@HTurner15 I think we probably have similar views on tax avoidance
@HTurner15 thanks Harryüòã I think I misunderstood your point as being specifically aimed at immigrants

@HTurner15 http://t.co/qImDhzEw98
@HTurner15 I wasn't sure if your charity point was to me personally but I do give to both an HIV research charity and the UNICEF aids help
@HTurner15 I understand your belief that that shouldn't be enforced
@HTurner15 I personally would still happily pay the pennies to treat anyone HIV positive but..
@HTurner15 many of the 60% of immigrants will be paying taxes and many of the 40% of English HIV positive won't be - it's difficult
@HTurner15 that's fine, I understand you then, but what I think is unfair is to generalise that we shouldn't be paying for immigrants
@HTurner15 but the problem here is how can we realistically expect to enforce this? I understand your logic but can't see it working
@HTurner15 you should use the NHS if you haven't paid, but many of them will have jobs and will pay. It wasn't specific to the unemployed
@HTurner15 I think my problem here is a lot of the HIV positive immigrants will be paying taxes. I understand the logic behind not thinking
@HTurner15 I'm not sure I do agree- isn't that the whole point of the NHS? we all pay in and we all pay out?
@HTurner15 does that logic extend to children and the unemployed then?
@HTurner15 @PatrickStrud HIV is horrific and I don't understand why the probably less than 1p a month is more important to people than lives
@HTurner15 @PatrickStrud because if the latter, I don't understand why it's more important a British person have treatment than an immigrant

Hollie and Chan are making me feel better about not winning this game... maybe that means I'm not addicted to online shopping...

@hollie_x @lauradevinzer I've not paid for my own holiday yet awh but ¬£7,000ish on my last family one
@LauraDevinzer ¬£1,200 on mine

@LauraDevinzer yes, it was beautiful. ¬£11 WELL SPENT
@planty94 @hazie98 that's what you're meant to think at the moment. Whore.
So apparently April's picked a Noah @hazie98
@planty94 oh
@SammyMcQueen28 I'll just change my name to Saige and it can be our lock instead.
@planty94 you also just assumed yourself that it'd be you getting with Doug and Noah and thus that I am in fact the alpha. #win
@hollie_x ew, I'm a lady, I'd never spit. Punching her in the ribs though...
@planty94 come to England first you whore
@SammyMcQueen28 I didn't steal anyone, you're still together as far as I know...

But you're right, we do deserve each other
@hollie_x I'm all for breaking up with her (temporarily) but I feel like it's too soon for Dublin... we need violence and Noah and Doug etc
Can we go back to talking about how I'm the alpha? I liked that conversation

@hollie_x @thisiskrys2 @planty94 we broke up?????
@planty94 no... shurrup, you don't know.

I'd offer to show you my brilliant (if I do say so myself) eye makeup but you can't see it :'(
Stupid phone camera, y u no recognise makeup
@planty94 honestly, I'm really not skinny... I'll take a picture of my shoes tomorrow because it's too dark now, you can't see the colour :(

@planty94 hiya
@planty94 if shoes is a euphemism then yeah ok April
my TL at the moment is so sexually frustrated it's unreal
it's always about the shoes
@planty94 that's better

@planty94 that's cheating
@planty94 and why would that remind you of me
putting April on the spot
@planty94 go on then

@planty94 hang on, it what now?
@planty94 and you will NEVER. KNOW. :)
@planty94 I didn't use all of it and that's a good idea! It's just 'cause the tub said to keep it in the fridge but that made it hard to use
THERE IS NO WAY SHE STARTED HER PERIOD AT 16 #MyMadFatDiary
WOAH HANG ON
@planty94 you won't mwahah &gt;:D and you should it was really good. It was kind of hard to get on though so I wouldn't keep it in the fridge

@OutAlive1985 I don't know, maybe they did that paperwork after or maybe it's just something else HO has overlooked/ignored :')
@OutAlive1985 it's okay, why do you ask? :)
just put on #CBB for the first time in my life and all I can say is "looks like he dressed up for the occasion"
also there was a guy in McDonald's who was eating his chips by tipping them into his mouth...
@OutAlive1985 Yeah pretty sure
walked home in the snow clinging on to Sam in boots with no grip. I must have looked like someone who was learning how to walk
@sammylovesHO he doesn't listen to what anyone says, he just jumps to conclusions
@AshDawsonFan3 @sammylovesHO @planty94 tah G :D xxx
@planty94 this still sounds like a euphemism
@planty94 is this a euphemism
RT @tezzabubbles: Proper hope Ste puts Doug in his place about who Leah's parents are now tbh

@SoapSquawk I'm sure you're not allowed to do this before they've been announced on ITV. I'm going to find out and get em to fucking sue you
@OutAlive1985 I know, I suppose they could be wrong, I'm just pissed at the website for thinking that was okay
@iamthescotslamb at least this way we could be pleasantly surprised... Idk I'm just so pissed
@OutAlive1985 we don't know thy they're not true and I don't see why they'd post it without knowing so I think they're probably right :(
@SoapSquawk what are you doing? These haven't been announced on the programme yet so why would you post this and ruin it for people
@iamthescotslamb oh no! I haven't looked at the results but I could sort of tell one from twitter's reaction... Why even leak them though
The website that leaked the results should be prepare for a strongly worded messageeeee
yeah Dermot look at all the comedians... so why didn't of them present it then?
RT @planty94: I'm already bored.

@AllAboutMystery yeah, but then she could have done anything to her hair and Make up and she'd still have looked beautiful
why show us the video from one interview and the audio from another?????
what if Emmett died doing that stunt though
@AllAboutMystery I think it's a combination of the colour and the material :| and also the frilly thing round her waist
RT @JadeClifford_LJ: these people seem to think i have patience or something hahahah
@AllAboutMystery she looks like a cupcake or a cracker or something :/
what's the point in showing us this interview if we can't hear you...
Wallis you're absolutely beautiful but what are you wearing
