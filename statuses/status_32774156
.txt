@nfl absolutely was not a personal foul at the end of course guys trying to save a touchdown of course he's going to throw a hit
#NFL that was not a penalty at the end of the fourth quarter the guy was trying to do anything to prevent a touchdown
#Steelers @espn @nfl that's a bullshit call because the guy was just trying to save a touchdown

@jenniceco you seem like you're very needy.
@AdrienneGang I don't know I always tip generously myself so I root for the cast members to always get a big tiplike
@AdrienneGang by the way liked u much better on  show than that g digger, u were awesome! Sam gave you a hard time she was young and immatur
@AdrienneGang i've had jobs back in my younger days where I relied on gratuity, I can't stand cheap asses that make excuses for not tipping
@AdrienneGang and I know you have some mixed feelings toward your old cast mates but  that guy was an ass you guys work hard for  tips
@AdrienneGang I know you're in the industry silly I watched you on the show last year and tweeted you before lol
@AdrienneGang please don't tell me you actually like that clown?
@timothysykes I guarantee u have no genuine friends.  only people around you because they think u have money.  They don't have wisdom yet
@timothysykes ur not the "bad mo f'er" u think u are! So what u got lucky in s market, u only have a pretty chic cause she thinks u have $.
@RenadaRomain it may be over reported but it's very scary and I would rather it be over reported than under reported in this particular case
@timothysykes @AdrienneGang @Bravotv I would never do business with someone with a personality like you have
@BenRobinsonChef you did an awesome job Timothy Sykes is a punk
@timothysykes @AdrienneGang @Bravotv I would never buy a book or DVD from somebody like u you need to learn to be nicer and not so critical
@timothysykes @AdrienneGang @Bravotv so what do you have to be so critical and hold everybody's feet to the fire really that big of a deal?
@timothysykes @AdrienneGang @Bravotv there's a lot to be said for someone's personality character   your character, personality sucks
@timothysykes @AdrienneGang @Bravotv You think because you have more money than those workers that you are above them they worked hard
@timothysykes @AdrienneGang @Bravotv I like Adrian Tim you're a punk you're an asshole you're a cheap bastard
@4AllFootball alright good talking to you I'm going to bed
@4AllFootball well DirecTV does have satellite Internet but Out on a boat  It can't possibly work that well
@4AllFootball I only spend $ and give bus. to people that have character and integrity he turned me off  I would never give him a penny
@4AllFootball  don't care how he makes  money seems like he's good with stocks that's awesome I don't like  how he treats people he's a punk
@4AllFootball I don't know what you're talking about the way he makes money?  what did I say about the way he make money
@4AllFootball he's a fucking clown, he obviously thinks he's better than the people that work in the service industry he thinks their slaves
@4AllFootball he's not that intelligent if he thinks that Internet is going to work well on a boat he's a fucking dumbass
@4AllFootball there's nothing wrong with being nice  personable not mean and ignorant because a person feels like they're above other people
@4AllFootball yeah I don't like the blonde haired bitch's  either but crew did work hard and didn't deserve to be gypped on the tip
@timothysykes if you were a cool laid-back guy that was kind &amp; generous I would def  consider buying some of ur products, but you're a punk
@timothysykes and you're not very smart if you had expectations of the Internet working well on a boat
@timothysykes if they followed instructions I'm sure they tried hard and did their best they rely on those tips u cheap ass
@timothysykes those people work hard to show you guys a good time ur a creep, I would never buy any product from you or give u  time of day
@timothysykes u deducting  tip,  blaming  Internet as 1 of the reasons  is sad every1 knows that Internet sucks outside USA, esp on boat!!!
@timothysykes you cheap ass you gypped them on the tip because you're probably low on money that was weak and your weak!!!
@timothysykes you cheap ass you gypped them on the tip because you're probably low on money that was weak and your weak!!! Such a douche
@timothysykes you are a complete douche bag and an asshole

@AmberNMarchese Bobby brags about having more money than you guys what does he do for a living how does he have such a big house?
@JLMarchese111 what does Bobby do for a living that makes him go around saying he has more money than you guys
@JLMarchese111 Bobby is going around telling people that he has way more money than you and you're jealous of him about his financial status
@JLMarchese111 honestly why do u think so many people are busting ur balls &amp; giving u a hard time? U didnt conduct yourself very well at all
@JLMarchese111 Bobby sold you out but maybe he did that to expose the punk that he always knew that you were
@JLMarchese111 I  admit what Bob did to you was dirty and I would never forgive him but if he wouldn't of done that we wouldn't have met u
@JLMarchese111 i'm not a celebrity why would I have followers, and people are only following you because you're a train wreck
@JLMarchese111 the word that describes you best, you're a "punk"
@JLMarchese111 you are such a douche, dick, ass, I know u don't have any real friends

@WhitneyyyEll I know you want to go back-and-forth with me but goodbye
@WhitneyyyEll A female dog is called a bitch that's where and why most of the people say that
@ed_lucas6 most people use the reference because a female dog is called a bitch "I  worked like a dog" come on man stop being petty
@AndrewSturby A female dog is called a bitch that's why most people use the reference not about females
@Kate_Chastain you are very good at your job,  awesome!  but yes honestly  you should smile more, you honestly do appear not happy!
@Kate_Chastain  not taking sides  I could actually care less  but watching  episodes u do appear  miserable  it's  how you look, honestly.
@deanpromo and that Korean girl was a whiny bitch who is she to complain so much!! She must be perfect. What an asshole!!
@deanpromo I am halfway through the episode and so far you seem like a total asshole  I want to see what kind of tip you leave!!!
@RenadaRomain That was a good song who was that
@stephenasmith good luck
@DougHehner Doug I really like you,  you're a cool dude,  you're a good looking dude,  why don't you get those moles removed from your face?
@WhitneyyyEll shut up what do you know
@AndrewSturby she over reacted and he was just taking up for her being a kiss ass!!
@AndrewSturby No dude there's nothing wrong with what you said "bitch work" means the shitty work the work nobody wants to do.
@WhitneyyyEll @jenniceco when someone says I got stuck with the bitch work they mean the sucky ass work the sorry ass work not the fem work
@WhitneyyyEll @jenniceco he did not mean it offensive towards women if you asked 100 people randomly in a grocery store u'd lose
@ed_lucas6 if you take a survey and ask 100 people about the whole bitch comment  you would lose that was petty and ridiculous
@ed_lucas6 yes the dude is and was a total douche but that doesn't mean that everything out of his mouth is racist or feminist
@ed_lucas6 If you want to get technical real squeaky clean technical I mean technical technical technical technical but it was fucking petty
@samiorme glad you're not on the show this year, you are insubordinate and immature.
@jenniceco the term "bitch work" is not derogatory or offense towards women, you just wanted to be mean to Andrew your an ass
@AndrewSturby there was nothing wrong with when you said "bitch work" that was ridiculous I totally got your back on that!!!!
@ed_lucas6 "Bitch work" is not derogatory nor is it offensive towards females are you an idiot?

@espn   people  definitely provoke t-selves into a situation, that doesn't excuse violence but it does happen!!
@mikeztyme its just like when someone gets arrested you could provoke the officer into making the situation worse that is what he meant!!!
@stephenasmith tell ESPN to take a hike!!!
@stephenasmith don't provoke a police officer while getting arrested is what you were pretty much trying to say, you CAN provoke a situation
@stephenasmith you didn't say anything wrong! What you were saying is like when someone is getting arrested and they resist, don't provoke
@MichelleDBeadle you're and idiot! people  definitely provoke t-selves into a situation, that doesn't excuse violence but it does happen!!

@DASHDAMON maybe 10 dudes standing on the corner asking about each other's pockets might be wrong but not when it comes to celebrities
@DASHDAMON us normal people we like to read about the trials and tribulations of celebrities so that includes a celebrity's finances
@DASHDAMON people ask about your money because of the way everything went down between you and Jay-Z and you know that dumbass
@DASHDAMON dude shut the fuck up people wonder about your money because you used to be an A-list celebrity that fell off because of Jay-Z
