@5WrightStuff they are not bad role models either, they are successful at business and educated, tv is to blame for focusing on the drama.
@5WrightStuff I don't believe so I fear they are just the easy blame, pop culture as a whole is where there influences lie
@5WrightStuff it is a natural thing that can/should be done anywhere, however if others feel uneasy they are entitled to their opinion/input
@5WrightStuff even if this is true, is it a smart move belittling the hard work these students have already done on results day?
@5WrightStuff yeah as it will give you a good insight into what changes are needed in your lifestyle
@5WrightStuff yes because children these days lack social skills, more face to face contact is needed
@5WrightStuff if you do the crime you should do the time, but prison isn't enough of a deterrent coz its too comfortable and too expensive
@5WrightStuff I think this is more a question of corruption how can we campaign for green living then do this #familyties #osbourne #corrupt
@5WrightStuff it's not that we love nasty people, it's if they weren't any it would just be everyday life, and no-one would watch my life
@5WrightStuff we must no longer live with this misconception that everyone should look a certain way, if you are happy and healthy your good
@5WrightStuff shame is the wrong way of going about it as it could lead to health issues, do it for your health or quality of life :)
@5WrightStuff in theory, but we must realise that wages are much lower these days, but cost of living is higher, the two don't go together!
@5WrightStuff the fact we have done shows that we believe no one has got over past events, remember them but don't let them control us
@5WrightStuff no, we need to get over this misconception that everyone should drive, it doesn't define who you are or the parent you are!
@5WrightStuff yes but we have to be aware that the children can be more tech advanced where responsibility should be higher on provider

@5WrightStuff why would they need one, they see their friends everyday, in theory you are subjecting them to further dangers in the world
@5WrightStuff no, use it to show them but putting pressure on for change could do worse they need to realise it themselves for it to be real
@5WrightStuff I will answer this with a question, is 40 too old to do what you want or love? Nope!

@5WrightStuff we should encourage people to find their own way, instead of singing manufactured music for a quick and short taste of fame
@5WrightStuff we cut funding to these sports in a time we should be encouraging exercise, the legacy is we just wanted to make money from it
@5WrightStuff what is normal?, I hate this ideal that we should strive to something that doesn't exist, just be the best you/unit you can be

@5WrightStuff the problem with renting is you pay as much as the mortgage per month, more should be done to lower these prices!
@5WrightStuff it all depends on the influences they have, people try and put the magnifying glass on the smallest thing to blame
@5WrightStuff not really if you start down this road it's easy to nit pick about each others discretions
@5WrightStuff a lot of this may be a mental health issue, not enough is being done throughout a persons life to combat this like screenings

@5WrightStuff No, they successfully reinvent it each time the doctor regenerates, when something's not broke don't fix it #DoctorWho

@danjayjohnson for instance start a running club for all levels all ya need is a pair of trainers which most have that won't cost 16 million
@danjayjohnson the thing is did you eat all healthy food? I know I didnt, costs would be minimal setting up teams at school but for everyone
@danjayjohnson yeah exactly, also I believe it's more than just a food issue,look what kids do for fun these days play games on computers
@danjayjohnson exactly it just seems to me some of these ideas are just to make it appear as they are trying to tackle the problem
@5WrightStuff if you are picking and choosing who to be nice too by looks well your worse than someone that doesn't full stop #manners
@5WrightStuff it's the people who are driving that are the issue at the end of the day they have chosen this type and should adhere to it.
@5WrightStuff how much are these pointless ideas costing?, I think by now people know that smoking is bad, more needs to be done in schools!
@alibrownlee the problem here is education, if the parents don't believe they are giving unhealthy food or are happy to, how will this work?
