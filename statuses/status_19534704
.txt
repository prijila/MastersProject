Rachel praying for someone to mess up is so Rachel in #TheAmazingRace
RT @billboard: Huge ovation for Ricky Martin and his dancers! Definitely a highlight of the #BBMAs.
Brendan and Rachel trying to steal the taxi cab was the lowest of the lows in #AmazingRace history.
Wow!  Rachel is on full bitch mode today on #TheAmazingRace
I really don't want Rachel to win #TheAmazingRace because she will start procreating.
I can't believe they are ending up in Vegas on #TheAmazingRace.  Unfair cause Brendan and Rachel live there.
RT @PhilKeoghan: RT if you’re rooting for #DaveAndConnor! #AmazingRace #RaceFinale
Connor is probably the strongest, all around competitor I've seen in the #AmazingRace
I must agree.

So we need to see more of this for Season 3! #Arrow #ArrowFinale @CW_Arrow @ColtonLHaynes http://t.co/jJkgHsIoUE
So Laurel gets a leather jacket from her sis and all of a sudden we're supposed to believe that she can kick ass?  I don't think so! #Arrow
So the fake Olicity moment on #ArrowFinale tonight was evil ... Got my hopes all up for nothing!
Green Arrow walking into the tunnel with Red Arrow to his right was epic! #Arrow #ArrowFinale @ColtonLHaynes @CW_Arrow
Just finished watching #Arrow season finale ... So awesome seeing Roy join Team Arrow as Red Arrow @ColtonLHaynes

Oh Dean, I love you, BUT you dumb-ass.  #Supernatural
Agents Spear and Aguilera! LoL #Supernatural
Oh Kurt, you drama Queen! Learn to pick your battles ... Blaine was just trying to be considerate of your feelings.  #glee

Rachel in #theamazingrace gives me another favorite moment in the race "I didn't know, I didn't know". Someone call her a wambulance!

“@hgtv: HGTV has decided not to move forward with the Benham Brothers' series.”

Kudos HGTV on keeping hate out of the airwaves #HGTV #NOH8
Finally, Sam and Dean working well together #Supernatural
OK, time for a new #Supernatural .  Bring it on!
Could you tell Chris Colfer wrote this episode of #Glee ?  He is in just about every scene!  A bit vain, don't u think?
Sam and McConaughey have more chemistry than Sam and Mercedes. #glee
Is #Glee trying to make me hate Rachel even more than I already do?  Let the kid adopt the dog, you selfish harpie!
Y is Candace still in #DWTS?  Based on talent, she should have gone weeks ago &amp; based on personality she should have been the 1st one out!
RT @ricky_martin: "Everyone has an annoying friend. If you don’t have one, it’s probably you. xD "
I was NOT going to watch #AmazingRace next week cause of the cowboys, but then I saw Rachel bawling her eyes out in previews ... #MustSeeTV
Oh my gravy, I will miss those cowboys #AmazingRace
So disappointed, but not surprised about Leo and Jamal showing their true colors #AmazingRace
Least favorite moment in #AmazingRace was afghanimals u-turning the cowboys :'(  #traitors
All time favorite moment in #AmazingRace seeing Rachel constantly hit the ground in running of the bulls. #smile
Stop whining Rachel! #AmazingRace
Just watched ep 10 of #SirensUSA ... Funniest wedding scene.  Love the cast.
Disappointed and a bit confused over #SupernaturalBloodlines tonight.  Want my boys back in full-force next week #Supernatural
This episode sucks!  The Winchesters are just set decorations.  Very out-of-character just to serve the launch of spinoff #Supernatural
I hope J2 got paid for a full episode this week #Supernatural
So the obvious question is when they shift to look like someone else, what happens to their clothes? #bloodlines #Supernatural
With the L train imagery in tonight's #Supernatural, I thought I was watching #Shameless for a second there.
Thank goodness, Dean and Sam just showed up #Supernatural
Am I watching #Supernatural?  Any episode without either Sam or Dean  (preferably both) in the first 15 minutes sucks. #changingchannels
Called it!  Predictable "loved-one"death to motivate character into a new series. Wait, didn't #Supernatural start similarly. #disappointed
I just know the fiancée is going to die to give guy motivation #Supernatural
RT @gabigirl8485: This picture feeds my soul #shameless #gallavich #ianandmickey http://t.co/4TojPTWTSF
Just caught up to Season 4 of #Shameless and #Gallavich makes me happy, sad, laugh, and cry.  More Mickey &amp; Ian please #showtime
I've lost all respect for #CNN over their ridiculous coverage of #Flight370 #enoughalready #cnnfail
Really dislike Brendan and specially Rachel in #AmazingRace
Brian and Billy interactions are comedy GOLD #SirensUSA
That's how I react to spiders too! #SirensUSA
Billy is back on #SirensUSA :-)
Ready for a new #SirensUSA !
You do NOT mess with Sammy when Dean's around! #Supernatural #SamNDean
No!!! Bring back the Trickster for good. #Supernatural
Yes!!! Trickster is back. #Supernatural
Captain America is Everything!  And the movie was good too. #CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier
The chemistry b/n Brian and Billy on the second episode of Sirens was sooo funny.  #GoofyInnocense #SirensUSA
Watching Sirens.  Great show, but they need to bring back Billy!  #SirensUSA
Is it just me, or are all the actor's playing the part of the Lance family in Arrow pretty terrible?  #Arrow
Roy's trip out of Starling City better be brief.  Colton is one of the best reasons to watch this show. #Arrow
Back to the cast of the first two seasons is the way to go for #glee  I'm watching again.
Sam and Mercedes ... What sexual chemistry?  #glee
Someone please tell #CNN that there are other thing going on in the world other than the #Flight370 incident. @cnnbrk @CNN
Oh, Roy.  You are breaking my heart ... Sure fire way to get Thea to stay away from you. #Arrow
Love Roy just taking a bullet for the team #Arrow !  More Roy, please.
Ok, the phone trick was awesome! #Supernatural
Now why would Sam walk alone into an abandoned convent and not let Dean where he is at? #Supernatural
Sharna, if you can't teach a proper tango then you don't deserve to be Charlie's partner!  #DWTS
Ugh, why why did they have to bring Gwyneth for #glee100 ?  Waste of time they could have used to feature more of the original players.
