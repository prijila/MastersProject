Cannot wait for #humans starting on Sunday
Todays correspondence has cemented the fact I will never use @groupon again and will tell anyone the same thing
First reply of the day from @Groupon_UK and its as empty as all of yesterdays. Just be honest #Groupon
2000 based on the film clue alone @brianmoore1
Hence the #WarOnGroupon @martynconnor as they think this is acceptable
.@martynconnor ordered a TV 3 weeks ago. Ignored our emails until yesterday &amp; now are saying it will be another week b4 I can have refund
Me too @Rhodez16 it seems that @groupon can't actually just be open and honest #WarOnGroupon
RT @Rhodez16: @ThisIsRichardJ I doubt it!! #WarOnGroupon
Lets see if Groupon will just give me a straight answer today. #WarOnGroupon
Apparently that's the end of it. @Groupon holds your money for 3 weeks. Blames you &amp; says it will be 1 week b4 you get it back #WarOnGroupon
5-7 working days for a refund. Well what's another week when we've gone 3 with no refund. #WarOnGroupon. Took the money quick enough
And so customer service replies. And they blame us for a delivery that wasn't even sent #WarOnGroupon.
End of day1 in the #WarOnGroupon. No response despite the promises made
@Groupon_UK Sorry for my skepticism but heard that one before today
@Groupon_UK @Groupon 25023865
@Groupon_UK @Groupon £360 out of pocket a&amp; no item for over 3 weeks.No answer up until today when I've emailed 10+ times &amp; posted on FB &amp; TW
@Groupon_UK @Groupon Already have done but will again.. It's my partners account so she will be sending the email - An answer would be great
@GrouponDetroit @Groupon_UK @Groupon Thanks but I've done that. Got responses for a bit but then completely stopped
.@Groupon has now been emailed from 3 different addresses. 2 of which have had no reply &amp; 1 has suddenly stopped getting replies. Moneyback?
RT @hotelgmtweets: Let the weekly clean up of #Groupon Spam Mail begin.

Been told #Groupon cannot speak to me as it wasn't my account - Fair Enough - they are now not replying to my partners attempts
Receiving the usual 'palm-off' answers from #Groupon but when it gets down to a straight answers complete radio silence
