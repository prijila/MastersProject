@justex07 definitely protect yourself.
@justex07 yes it does. Just don't let it change who you are, you're such a great person. üòä
@justex07 being a nice person makes it easy to be taken advantage of, unfortunately.
The weather is gorgeous!
Someone needs to cancel work today so we can all spend the day outside.
@Josef19 yay! Congrats!
Okay. Time to find something different to watch. I've now watched enough football to never need to watch it again.
Whoa. Fights.
@Aubs89 @everythingsjake that's what I'm trying to figure out. Wasn't everyone done with Heroes before it was finished the first time?
What?? Heroes? Heroes reborn??

@oskrNYC @Angelous8103 I don't see outrage worthy either. Just shock.

Come and knock on my door.
I'll be waiting for you.
I'm hoping that fedex will get here before I have to leave for work. I doubt they will, but still hoping.
@shayes287 agreed.
@twelvesouth I'm really excited about the Surfacepad, not a fan of many cases. I'm surprised how fast it's shipping, just ordered on Sunday.
@jholman23 @oskrNYC @Airrun I got my iPhone 6 yesterday as well! I ordered the @twelvesouth Surfacepad, I get it today.
@TimmyShea I never thought about this possibility.

@marcusbryan but last night's date was especially good. We had great conversations. I'm really looking forward to dinner with him.
@marcusbryan yea. I don't usually have multiple dates with different guys. But I do this week.

I had only one glass of wine left, and have already finished it. So, who would like to come over with a bottle of wine and hang out?
@brainalishi there has to be something wrong with that rice for it to cook in 1 minute.

It's been a long day. Ready for some tv and relaxing.
@kevmdooley it's disappointing that there is no understanding or sympathy for people.
@kevmdooley it truly can be. I always expect those people to be someone else, not other gay men.

@Airrun @Angelous8103 I'm catching up on Nurse Jackie. It's different, not as much over-the-top drama, but it's fantastic.
@Angelous8103 the opening scene on the roof waiting for the helicopter was so bad, looked like a freshman series on a low budget network.

@marcusbryan oh yea. I ordered with Next. (It took us adding it as an option @ Ô£øStore and training for me to understand it.)
@shayes287 I'm hoping someone in Cupertino wasn't waiting on me to do something...
@marcusbryan all carriers with contracts do that. It's a silly fee for sure.
@adocekal keep trying.
@aaronhoff amateur mistake. üòâ
@adocekal not many people are having much success, lots of errors. And just the 6, 6+ is too big for a phone. At least for me.

Successfully ordered through the app.

I hate that my birthday is on Labor Day weekend, which most view as the end of summer. Which is usually depressing, like all the fun is over
I'm lucky to have such amazing people in my life.

I'm at Apple Store, West County in Saint Louis, MO w/ @eddiestl2 https://t.co/YTOB6AaPDE
Although it started as a total mess, today ended up being a great day. It's nice to have things going well again.
There's a person that I'm missing quite a lot. Love is a bitch.
@BoyStar22 yes, and jealous. Haha
@BoyStar22 I have 0, you have 2. I'd say that you are winning. Lol
@BoyStar22 how many boyfriends do you have? I can't keep up. üòâ
@simple a life goal to move to SF.
Hmmmm, I'm feeling a bit empty.
I have thoroughly enjoyed the thunderstorm though. And the beer.
Today has been a bit of a weird day off work. Nothing strange happened. Just a bit off.

@justex07 I'm not, there's no reason to have gelatin in yogurt. It's an unnecessary ingredient when yogurt is made properly.
@justex07 @NoosaYoghurt used to be just as good with half the ingredients, including no gelatin. Then it got complicated and added gelatin.
@justex07 gelatin and pectin are not the same. Pectin comes from fruits, gelatin comes from animals.
@justex07 I'm talking about gelatin, not pectin. I'm just fine with pectin. But not okay with yogurts adding gelatin. It's not needed.
@justex07 @NoosaYoghurt their ingredient list used to be so simple, and didn't include gelatin. But they changed so I went back to @Chobani.
