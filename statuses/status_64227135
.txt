@steincollector not sure. I am no liberal and I have no irrational fear of four letter words.

@andreajez I commute to Madison every day for my job too :) It sucks, but there are no good jobs in Janesville after GM closed it's doors.
@andreajez That's okay. Everybody does it at some point :)
@andreajez That is AWESOME and is what America is all about :)
@andreajez I couldn't agree more. Never accepted a handout in my life. I've worked HARD for what I've got and everybody else should too.
@RAD2of3 @talkmaster and that's the way it should be. But, comparing Obama to Al Qaeda solves nothing and stops any meaningful dialogue.
RT @RAD2of3: @PDestrucity wrong on that account. @Talkmaster is a maker, not a taker. He is on the right side.
@frontmantrue You too! Glad you don't take all of this shit SO seriously.

@frontmantrue Why didn't you just write "pussy"? I'm pretty sure you fooled NOBODY with the $ signs.
@ygbsmgc @talkmaster the current political dialogue is a major reason why we NEVER deal with actual issues in this country. I disagree.

@IanSaysSo @TheRock being a surprise entry into the rumble, winning it, and confronting the new unified champ would draw HUGE interest.
@IanSaysSo True, but he = good business for the @WWE... and it seems they're planning on using him around WM time again.
@IanSaysSo Or you could do that as well. I just figured my idea would tie in well with @TheRock's storyline about "becoming WWE Champion".
@iBeaDom Awwww... That's too bad. I would LOVE to see that LOL
@IanSaysSo @WWE Or unify them in a champ vs champ match, and have the winner of the rumble face off with the new champ. @TheRock perhaps?

@freddurst Maybe you should rework the words to Rollin' for Monday Night Football?
@RealRightRepub Yeah, but any politicians of consequence leave that part out when speaking publically. Just tired of finger pointing.
@RealRightRepub I'm doing that right now actually. Have found nothing thus far. But, thank you for the extremely rude response.
@RealRightRepub It's the same to me as when liberals blamed Bush for everything. They had congress and the senate.
@RealRightRepub All I hear is "Obama's policies" and "Obama's failure." I just want a little more perspective and less finger pointing.
@RealRightRepub This is not a snide response, but could you please send me a clip? An article? I have yet to hear him mention Bush.
@THEHermanCain Question: shouldn't you also mention Bush's failed policies as well? Bad economy started before Obama was even sworn in.
@gop @TheDemocrats Enough with the political posturing! Americans are hurting out there! Stop pointing fingers and get things done!
Shame on the media for their latest contrived "non" troversy over #Favre's comments. He was complimenting @AaronRodgers12 for Christ sake!

@MattPhillips22 Doesn't look like it mattered LOL
Question: Why is @AaronRodgers12 still out there? This game is BEYOND over. Another very Patriot-like decision by Mike McCarthy.
Anybody who has @AaronRodgers12 as their fantasy QB are hearing the sound of slot machines going off right about now. DAMN!
@NFLRandR Is it safe to say that with all the free agents and the expectations for the Eagles this year, is Andy Reid's job in jeoprady?
#Packers are starting to remind me of the Rams "Greatest Show on Turf" from the early 2000's. Defense can't stop anybody, but the O is BOSS!
#Broncos are coming to life. The #Packers really look like they miss Jenkins. The pass rush is not getting home and leaving safties exposed
@MattPhillips22 That's what I was just saying on Facebook LOL! I HATE that onside kick earlier.
DAMN Green Bay... You're gonna do the Broncos like that? An onside kick in the 1st quarter? #Packers #Broncos
You know that #Woodson kid for Green Bay is pretty good. I think he's got a future in this league! #Packers # Broncos
BANG! Just like that, it's 6 on the board! #Packers #Broncos #Rodgers #Nelson
So much for the "Dream Team". That defense made Alex Smith look like a  competent QB today.
Mike McCarthy, I know the #Broncos aren't any good this year, but you do realize they are an #NFL team right? It's the 1st qtr, take the 3!

#Packers @JermichaelF88 & @AaronRodgers12 are making it look too easy so far against the #Bears.
Why are the Vikings not feeding @AdrianPeterson? You had a 20 - 0 lead. GRIND - THAT - CLOCK!

'Bout time Lions! That's what you should have been doing the entire first half! As for the Vikings... another second half collapse?

@realMickFoley @johncena I like the more focused, less contrived intensity of the closing segment. Felt like genuine emotion.
@scott_springer @CMPunk I think putting obstacales in Punk's way is a good thing. Altough, he should be closing the show not Cena right now.
@UltimateFurby Sometimes you just have to face facts. They should hit the reset on the tag division. Have an open tournament. Something new.
@PWRshow Now, if they'd done that with Cena more often over the last seven years, people over the age of thirteen would've stuck with him.
@ReviewFix Yeah... They have a TON of talent, and can't do ANYTHING with it. Frustrating to watch.

@scott_springer I gave up on MTV over a decade ago now. You should do the same and spare yourself the headache LOL
Difference in the game was what it always has been the problem for the Mavericks. They are jump shooters with no interior scoring threat.
@ReviewFix Agreed. But, the Mavs simply aren't athletic enough to keep up with the Heat. Which is why they need to win games like this.
If the Mavs don't win this game, the series is over. Momentum has been on their side all game. Jumpshots are falling. #Mavericks #Heat #NBA

Final thought on #RAW , I wonder if the Nexus will get as big as the NWO did in WCW, when 25 guys would show up at the arena in limos. #WWE

@AminadabRPF @broncostweeters Atwater was a BEAST in the secondary.
@AminadabRPF @broncostweeters That I can agree with. The whole defense needs to be re-evaluated. 32nd is not just scheme. It's talent.
@AminadabRPF @broncostweeters I agree, but it could have been improved with work on the defense. Same as the Texans.
@AminadabRPF @broncostweeters Now the whole thing, from coaching  on down has to be rebuilt. I don't see how this is an improvement.
@AminadabRPF @broncostweeters What they have now isn't better than 8-8. One solid offseason to improve defense and they're back in the mix.
@AminadabRPF @broncostweeters @DenverSportNews Now they have Tebow, who is talented, but still a project, and still have worst the defense.
@AminadabRPF @broncostweeters @DenverSportNews At least when Shanahan was there, they had a franchise QB, Pro Bowl WR, and solid running.
@AminadabRPF @broncostweeters @DenverSportNews I would have to disagree. Problem under Shanahan is the same as it is now... Defense. 32nd.
@DenverSportNews I feel sorry for Broncos fans. Firing Shanahan last season has turned this team into a rebuilding franchise. #Broncos
@HulkHogan4Real Sorry to hear about your mother passing Hulk. I remember watching you and your parents celebrating your first WWF title.
