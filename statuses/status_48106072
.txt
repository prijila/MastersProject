@sprintcare .... The next day I went to "early upgrade", I was told different, saying that I had to pay an early upgrade fee.....

That new chrome book is pretty useless lol. But that's my opinion. I'd rather get an iPad.
I mean, I don't believe in abortion, I just think that when the baby is born, the parents better grow up real fast.
I see girls my age and younger getting pregnant, and they think it's ok.
I don't want to sound offensive, but if you're under 18 and pregnant, you shouldn't really be proud of that.
