After over 24 hours of #iTunes10 generally squatting around pretending to re add the files it has "lost"...
I then led #iTunes10 by the hand to the place where the network library had been all along and asked it to drink from it's goodness.
Upgraded to #iTunes10 yesterday. It then insisted my network library had spontaneously disappeared of it's own accord.
