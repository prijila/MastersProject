Anyone else see @joehaden23 today? No? Apparently Oakland's offensive game plan was to avoid his side. Smart. But not enough. #BrownsNation
Great drive. Playoff type drive. Would love the high draft pick, but damn winning is fun! #Winning #BrownsNation
@bweeden3 + @JOSH_GORDONXII = TD all day long. #BrownsNation
Another FG- #Dawson2PBowl #BrownsNation
Could Shurmer be any more predictable? TRich had nearly every play. Mix it up #BrownsNation

@DStahlInc bad idea
@RJ_TMC @Popki4 ..Typical horror - HS kids doing documentary @ site of former mass murder. So bad it's funny.. sort of. Watch for "Slugger".
@RJ_TMC @Popki4 - Probably Amazon (I purchased for &gt;$5). Partially joking, friends with an actor in it. Gore film done wrong - true B movie.
@RJ_TMC try "Devils Grove". It may change your life.

@udidactivation how do I download beta 2?
@udidactivation Thanks for the reply. Download went well. A lot of phone freezes, is that normal?
@udidactivation Also, Is that Siri server separate from the UDID purchase? And if I don't update Beta's ASAP, will phone brick?
@udidactivation i Ordered UDID 1/2 hr ago.. Any idea of an ETA when I can activate? Still no activation email
