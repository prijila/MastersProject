@JonathanWorent @graphical_force At the company I am in, we tried it at a big scale (20 projects between 4 devs)  it was not productive.
@JonathanWorent @graphical_force But does agile prove to be any better of a process when that happens?
@graphical_force @JonathanWorent I find, realistic scopes and intelligent scheduling based on work load is the key to success [2/2]
@graphical_force @JonathanWorent I have never found agile development to work at a scale of 100 projects a year with a small team [1/2]
@_dte Thats awesome, congrats!
@graphical_force But at some point there needs to be profit on projects, not on limiting staff salaries. [2/2]
@graphical_force I can see that happening. At points, I could understand the scope creep to ensure happy clients while starting out. [1/2]
@graphical_force Very often. It was, in my opinion, a major role in losing profitability on projects, and productivity of staff.
