@RossMitchell80 yeah getting a little upgrade like.  Slightly different colour but higher spec.
@RossMitchell80 I guessed that. Read this morning Pardew is still looking to make a marquee signing.  De Jong looks a great buy!
@RossMitchell80 Up Friday night but gotta go back Sat night. Ah right fair enough. Heard you were thinking about it. Very jealous.
@RossMitchell80 Ah right cool. Can't wait to come up like. Hopefully heading to Hillsborough for the pre season game next week as well.

Making the most of what might be the last sunny day. Cutting my own lawn for the first time and spent the mo http://t.co/wzfpRHL9
@TomPerrinWWFC yea I'm the reserves to.
@TomPerrinWWFC you playing for the first team fella?
@liamebell yeah he told me he was going to, sort it out @Mitch0180. He'll blame as I have all his lenses on a long term loan basis.
@liamebell well I reckon with or without camera you'll be #plank. Is it all fully booked up then?
@liamebell makes sense. You should be sorted then. Without spending a fortune on other accessories. So you going on Sunday then?
@liamebell good lad. Well a UV filter might be an idea to give your lens some protection. Don't think there out else.
@liamebell memory card. Go to http://t.co/i0Rrh2OU and get a card or two. I only buy the brand sandisk
Gutted that I had have ice on my ankle again just started playing again. #aching

@RossMitchell80 you get my email today?
@virginmedia So it is in my name then. Well i want my 30mb/TiVo/Phoneline in my new property then as that is also in my contract.
@virginmedia Ok then, so that'll mean I can just leave it in the house and not pay as the contract is for the house not me.
@virginmedia …you can provide. And the fact you said we have taken a contract out but its with house is dreadful. I pay the bill!
@virginmedia Yes its for an early cancellation, we wouldn't cancel if you could provide he package, or at least a reasonable fee for what...
Might have to download the dev copy of iOS 6 tonight. No Bose headphones today so tried some iPhone earphones #awful #SpoiltEars

Rant over. Busy week, only tonight and Thursday at home and I have photos to edit and boxes to pack. #rush #WhenDoIPanic
So after my rant about @virginmedia I have to say now I would not recommend Virgin and inparticular #TiVo. Poor service and slow #TiVo
To keep @virginmedia would mean a new 18 month contract as they take the contract with the house. The house doesn't pay the bill!
To cancel @virginmedia its £180, to keep its £80+ to install then £40 quid a month for phone and 10mb broadband and no #TiVo
Won't be using @virginmedia again. Can't provide cable to our new home so we have to pay 2/3 of the price for a 1/3 of the package.

@andycmitchell poor guy. Forgot to ask you last night while I was on phone about how safc got on yesterday???
@liamebell Yeah I have that but I didn't want to watch it on there. The goal deserved MOTD.
Tired this morning after long weekend but I blame Ben Arfa for me being tired. Well I couldn't go to bed without seeing his goal #NUFC

Perch only got done once by Walcott and certainly but the effort in to stop him. Now just to show the same determination with Norwich #NUFC
Gutted about the result. On a positive side a few more games for HBA will get to grips with the prem. Shola did nothing wrong... #NUFC
@Davie_Mitch96 Kurl? Who's Kurl? You got Kurl on the mind not just on your head ;)
@Davie_Mitch96 well it's not impossible. We need Ba to play like he did earlier in the season, RVP no to turn up and plenty of luck.
We need a good solid opening 20 minutes unlike the spurs game. 4-5-1 for me. Jones left and HBA on the right. Ba up top. #NUFC
Come on Newcastle, I have faith. Can't stand Wenger. Arsenal used to play the best football in the league #NowIdRatherWatchSwansea #NUFC

Monday morning feeling. Up even earlier to get the earlier bus so I get in on time. Was a struggle getting out of bed at 6.
Friday. Gunna get into this project again. What to listen to?
@Mitch0180 yeah. Get started early and hopefully get finished early. Don't want to risk anything with this like
Lovely calm and clear night in Nottingham, shame I can't see out of the bus cos its that dirty.
Loves not realising the time because I was blasting through my project. Just made it though.
Luckily you didn't play last night because I would of had a bad back this morning from carrying you
@liamebell they were awful. We did have one new lad come in who got 17 goals. He just couldn't miss
Aching a bit today. But gunna get on project today big time. Even scraped a win at power league last night 25 nil.
@Mitch0180 Don't really just am. Been a fairly good day without any hitches. What do mean I had a win?
In a good mood tonight even though I know I have 75 images to edit when I get home.
What could be worse than getting stuck in traffic on the way to work? Ermm... Getting stuck in traffic on your way home!

Morning! Hope my day isn't going to consist of traffic jams. Can't even get into Loughborough this morning and I'm up against the M1 yet!
@SRibbons yeah course. This weeks wasn't as funny. But last weeks and the liam neeson sketch was unbelievably funny!
@KissabiX that sounds cool will have to see x

@RossMitchell80 I was meant to so mam could see it!
@RossMitchell80 what u mean?
@A_Mitch93 The one against Forest? I see you you got them in the FA youth cup
Looking forward to Life's Too Short
A wifi network just popped up on my phone 'pretty fly for a wifi' amused me!
Skepta covering 'all of the lights' is awesome. Can't stop listening to it.
@A_Mitch93 good stuff. Watched one of ur games on ur dads safc account the other. U got fluked an assist. Recorded the lfc res game to
At in Durham with my mo bro. Should be a laugh, it's been to long. I hope it doesn't become as infamous as the last one! @Mitch0180 agree?
More #jquery today, it's awesome. Created my first little plugin nothing major but still learning. Now to prepare for wkend
@A_Mitch93 you've joined twitter at last. Back up north this wkend, who u got on Saturday?
@liamebell live lounge vol 6, disc 1, track 14, skepta covering all of the lights #NotToShabby
I have been getting this bus for a few months now and I'm jealous of the girl who is on every day and sleeps the entire time. #jealous
@Mitch0180 Heres a link to the list of books http://t.co/eOhHsBFH. Just click it and it will take you to amazon.
Massive queue of traffic over Trent bridge. Come on I want to get to work.
#listeningto Crazytown -butterfly . Tune
Interested to see how the #mufc game goes this wkend. I reckon we can get a point against them. I think tiote is back #fingerscrossed #NUFC
@undipants crepe and a bong
Watching the game showed that they are beatable and still believe #NUFC did well at the wkend. I even read praise for #NUFC and we didnt win
Watched the 2nd half of the mcfc game. When a team has players of that talent anything can happen. Balotelli, silva and Sergio #awesome
Listening to guns n roses on the bus to work to make sure I'm awake today!
Beautiful morning in the east midlands. Still bloody freezing like. Gunna nail the stuff I have to do at work. #focused
Nearly in Loughborough. I feel knackered today. Lazy night.
Long day. And some dodgy bloke in Notts was definetly taking sly photos of people. There street is photography and then there is being sly!
today has seemed like a long day! #BedTmeYet
The girl behind me on the bus sounded like she should be in all hollyoaks #iKnowTheGossip
Trying to get my head round this new site CMS thing. I don't even know what you call it #iMustBeMissingSomething/
Gunna be a late one into Nottingham #Traffic
Listening to live lounge, skepta's cover of all of the lights isnt too bad.

As said by the main man himself (Alan Sheaer) the England team are going to require a lot of luck to win this world cup!
