@shazza10one Not anymore. Had a lot of fun but tough to make a lot of their games.
@shazza10one That is correct. (Chris Farley in Billy Madison voice)
Have no ties to Curie but feel awful they lost. Tough end to a fun team to watch and one of the greatest kids to ever play in the state.
Gonna be hard for Cliff Alexander to be Mr. Basketball now.
Cliff and Curie lose in regional semi. At least we saw the game against Young earlier. Sad end to their season.
RT @michaelsobrien: Cliff Alexander didn't just get up from the floor, he did a bunch of push-ups first.
RT @michaelsobrien: Cliff Alexander beat the buzzer with a dunk that approached the speed of light. I didn't really see it, I just heard it.

If the #CPD would let protesters speak, there would be not one ounce of violence. They are forcefully removing people away.
@CCkeys Exactly. That's why there is no justification for NATO to still exist.

@ChitownHeiress Yes I own a TV. But more importantly, I was there and saw a very large majority of non-violent ppl.
@ChitownHeiress It's a PEACEFUL protest. Not violent. Why would you think that Protestors want to start violence? They don't have guns.
@ChitownHeiress All they're trying to do is say they're against war. They're not bad people.
@StateStSports Why do you think they're scumbags?

Espn cannot have any show without discussing a Boston sports team. Why are they showing Buckner replays?
I wish this damn #catchinghell doc would end already.

RT @Smilewithkyle #Oktoberfest in Chicago.
@mcouill7 @zpeck2 nice. I woulda had 9 on the Chelsea match but Drogba scored in the 94th minute and screwed me.
RT @StateStSports: #Packers fan on street, "Sir how do you get to Field Museum." My response, "Take the Red Line South until last stop," ...
Wow what a drive by Nani. Nasty.
@ScottMurray3 In ALL sports you take away opportunities from your team if you don't take advantage of all foul/penalty chances!
Chicharito has been down on the pitch more than anyone this year. What a bitch.
@ebertchicago Any films from Chicago Int'l Fest you are dying to see?
Welcome back Drogba!!!!! 4-1 Chelsea!!!!

Why am I forced to explain a huge company like Groupon to multiple phone reps of Aloft Hotel? Shall I explain E-Mail too?

Messi's passes have been absolutely incredible this second half.
RT @SoccerDotTel: Tell you what, Arsenal could really do with a goalscoring playmaker like Fabregas.
