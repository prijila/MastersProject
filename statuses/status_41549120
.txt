@shakinthetent Chipotle is the preferred remedy for chronic hunger.  Side effects my include sleepiness, contentment, and pure bliss.
RT @feliciaday: Did an interview with the Star Wars site! http://bit.ly/7ieuBn
@aeazel Cool.  I'm going to pick up Dracula X/SotN for PSP, then I'll probably pick that up used for the Wii.
@aeazel I don't think I had ever even heard of No More Heroes, but after reading what you wrote about it I really want to play it.
Chipotle!  Nom nom nom!
Just voted The Guild for Best Online Video Web Series http://mashable.com/owa #openwebawards
I had to sell way too many copies of Sarah Palin's book today.  The worst was the guy who bought that and the Glenn Beck book... barf
Apparently I always say something political on here.  Hmm...  Guns are bad! @nicholaskai
Doctor Who!
RT @simonpegg http://ow.ly/C7vM  I'm all for gun control, but this is just stupid.
Note to UT Defense:  Are you kidding me?!?
It is not my fault that you suck.
To Sen. Lamar Alexander: Americans can't wait anymore. Health insurance reform must pass this year http://bit.ly/r2eoE #hc09 #TN #37043
@aeazel Re: Y - Still my favourite comic.  Poor 355 and poor Yorick.
@Negro_Joe You're going to compare youtube anime riffers to MST3K?  Really?  Wow...
Wow, these scripts really suck.  Was I this bad two years ago?
First Rough Cut is done! Just watched it and I can't wait to get some input! @faultywriter
Having a blast editing @faultywriter 's flick.  Looking better all the time.
An odd feeling in my heart, a melancholy dustbowl...
In search of a black wig for my Halloween costume.
My WWII doc blows.  Ready to move onto something new.
RT: @drhorrible http://bit.ly/12Rnx3 Reading: Save #Dollhouse, keep it on TV
Rain sucks
Wedding rehearsal done.  Catholic ceremonies are bizarre...
Making sure all the stuff fits for the wedding then the rehearsal stuff.
Holy crap the new security section it the Nashville airport is great.  got through in record time
In Columbus tomorrow, Woo!
RT @drhorrible Tomorrow night, will you be watching? http://bit.ly/uJpfj #DollhouseSeasonTwo YesOhYES I will!
RT @cwgabriel the people responsible for this should go to jail: http://bit.ly/NGkq6
@rifftrax Just watched 'The Room' and loved it.  Can't wait for the showing at the Belcourt next month here in Nashville!
I need to get going on the homework, but this footage just sucks and its a pain picking between two shitty shots.
Shit
Tailgating right outside Neyland Stadium.  Getting pumped for the game!
Watching the game with Jesse.  Contemplating murder...
@aeazel Congratulations!
@aeazel Re: PAD.  He has a really good command of some characters and not at all for others.  Some is shit, but X-Factor was good.
@Dy_L_An That is pretty hilarious.  We'd never write something like that, though.  Way too many holes in the plot.
@ThatKevinSmith Would love to see you come to Nashville, TN!  Miami (any part of FL) does not count as the south.  We deserve attention too!
@Dy_L_An Simon Pegg in Problem 3!  I knew you scientists were thugs what with those razors in pencil cases.
Teh internets are not working.  Sleep now.
I just got a great concept for my next script thanks to my best friend.  It has a whole structure already!
Go see Inglorious Basterds!  NOW!  Best Tarantino since Pulp, not even joking.
I was having such a great week until waking up feeling like death.
Back to the Future is on TV.  Ah, nostalgia.
#datemyavatar Video drops today from @theguild.  I wants it!
Loved District 9!
@aeazel RE: VGCats.  The Colbert Report parody he did a few months back was another 'gamer' subset.
Still awake.  Don't want to be.  Sigh.
@aeazel RE: teleportation: It is one of the better ones.  Definitely in my top5, if not top3.  Flying does have the most fantasy attached
Reba Mcentire has the scariest smile ever
@aeazel RE: CV: SotN - "What is a man!?"  One of my top games ever.
Thanks @aeazel http://bit.ly/avFee  If you want to be my friend forever, get me a red and orange one.
@chasingcharlsey yes, yes he is.  Welcome to 2007! ;)
Someone in nashville is doing noises off... Hmm
@aeazel Ending from the Comic or the Movie?  Just so you know it is more of a set up for the sequel rather than an ending.
@Dy_L_An Yeah.  The art, design, concept, comedy, and writing were great... but the game is so fucking hard.
Oh now I remember why  Earthworn Jim made me break two controllers...
Tick tock, tick tock, tick to-aagghhh!!
It just got dead at work.  Stuck at the register.  Blah
My heart just isn't in it today.
@aeazel Getting through the story of AC is a lot of fun.  I never bothered with the extra shit either.
@aeazel Very true.  There has yet to be a truly good movie adaptation of a video game.  I don't think the medium crosses over well.
Here is what I hate about horror movies.  People who should be smart make the dumbest decisions imaginable, which lead to their death.
Watching Alien all the way through for the first time.  Giger knows how to do creepy shit.
Sick of me.
I'm just a big fucking moron who can't write down his work schedule properly
@Dy_L_An yes, but I needed a pretty girl to tell me to do it first.
Dollhouse was great once I got past the first ep.  Looking forward to seeing @feliciaday in the 13th ep, plus the next season.
Netflix here   http://www.netflix.com/BeMyFriend/P9v6S38velwEB2gTeYzL
Friend me on Netflix here.  http://bit.ly/13bN7f
@Dy_L_An yes, but I'm not sure if I'm going.  Already spending too much as it is.
Waiting for Harry Potter to start.  We got a 1210 showing so i'm 10 minutes behind everyone else
@Dy_L_An Its DSL, so I guess that means purgatory.
@Dy_L_An Yes, apparently they have Twitter in heaven... or hell.  Which do you think would have the internet?
Got into a minor car accident.  Unfortunately cops were called so i'll be here a while...
New Torchwood was fucked up and awesome.
Get me out of here!
Very grumpy this morning.  Many things pissing me off
How do you confuse a blonde?...

Just finished 'Pygmy' by Chuck Palahniuk.  Pretty good, definitely his best since Choke.
Working in the music section.  Boredom reigns supreme.
It took me 10 minutes to go through all of my voicemail... its been a while.
Okay.  Better... Inexplicably
Empty...
Truly appreciates the phrase "no rest for the wicked"
Facing the music.
Almost said 'its not you its me' tonight... I am a piece of shit
Beautiful breakdown...
Had a very fun evening talking about Harry Potter and Danny Boyle.
Anyone who leads their argument with 'the bible says' automatically loses that argument

abyss of sleep
Had a good day.  Actually going to bed tired.  An accomplishment.
5 page script with 12 lines of dialogue! Woot!
@aeazel I loved that storyline.  The last thing I read was the end of the war.  I really want to see where it has gone now.
@aeazel Do you read Pictures For Sad Children? http://tinyurl.com/cq9q72  He mentioned that show as well.  Hilarious comic.
Did some more writing.  A bout one more page and the MOS script will be done.
Stupid Charter plus netgear router equals boring internetless night
Watch Timecrimes. It's awesome. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480669/
I need a new TV series to watch.  Any suggestions?
@aeazel Can't believe you never read Pride & Prejudice.  Great book.

Just DLed Incredibad
Hope there are no zombies or giant spider monsters awaiting me in my dreams.
