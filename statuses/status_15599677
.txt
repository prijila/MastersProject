In a couple of months I'll be mrs. In my past I was scared of this level of commitment. I cannot wait until September.
They say I'm up-and-coming like I'm fucking in an elevator.

@froggy432 "wait who still has their Jew tattoo? ... Oh shit I was thinking of x-men, sorry"
I drive smart, I drive safe, I drive courteous. Can you say the same?
If I'm not going over the speed limit I'm not in the left lane unless other vehicles are merging. End of.
...I would have been pinned between 2 semis in front and back &amp; no space in the right lane. In my tiny car, I would have died.
I try to stay a minimum of 2 car lengths apart from other vehicles on I-20 but if I had needed to hit my brakes @rab_racing was so close...
This area has enough traffic problems without adding a semi that is speeding, tailgating small cars, &amp; changing lanes like you're in a sedan
Pro tip: Maybe if you have your name all over your truck @rab_racing you shouldn't drive like an asshole.

@Sibry you better fix that shit. Wanna borrow my sonic screwdriver? It's intermission now. Joy.
@Sibry hi again. Just changed costumes. Waiting to go right back on :)
@Sibry brb gotta go act
@Sibry my characters French. She lives there. And are you sure it's cold this time of year in 1965? Because that's when I am.
@Sibry she doesn't end up leaving. They're transferring me to a new plane so I get to stay in Paris all night.
@Sibry my character is on her way to the airport. She won't be back on stage for another 7-8 minutes
@Sibry in my defense I didn't have time to read it before my cue to be onstage anyway lol. I'm in the middle of a show right now.
@Sibry too many words. Got bored.
It's one of those nights where you suck it up and cry about it later but now the show must go on.

@froggy432 you have the soul of a poet.
@JareBear1787 my tweets not my tweeds. I could never be angry at such a fabulous fabric.
Dear Los Angeles, Hollywood writers, and standardless actors, when I get back there you've got some serious explaining to do.
@froggy432 and I totally love you. I'm mad at Hollywood right now. &gt;o (that's mah angry face)
@JareBear1787 and gossip girl.
@JareBear1787 I should be your hundreth follow. Although my tweeds lately consist of hating on played out Hollywood plot devices
@kandipiehole honestly I'm not even team Dan anymore. I think the show should be Nate Eric Serena and chuck and Blair. Fin.
@kandipiehole she never grew on me in the first place. I dislike Taylor momsen but I hate little j. Always have. Always will.
@Sibry read my latest tweet about hoywood and their pricktastic intelligence insulting plot devices. Again I emphasize, dead horse.stick
