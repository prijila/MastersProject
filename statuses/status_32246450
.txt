Better carry over will be made from strength training, stability, plyometric type methods. These methods are easier to monitor progression
adding resistance to the movement doesn't always guarantee performance. (Punching with bands, kicking a ball with bands)
You will make better adaptations to mitt work if done without added resistance and vice versa with resistance/speed/agility training
Mitt work is a skill set based exercise and you do not combine this with any kind of performance enhancement type training.
If you have trainer who makes you do mitt work with bands attached to your legs and arms then you need to hire a new trainer.
Don't over complicate your workouts. Keep it simple, safe and effective.
Other fruits that can be added to your diet to improve insulin sensitivity are blueberries, black/red raspberries, tart cherries #nutrition
High insulin resistance usually exists when one has chronic inflammation, a state that commonly goes along with obesity or diabetes.
The high antioxidant content in strawberries can counteract this negative response. Eat them to improve insulin health,decrese inflammation
Eating meals high in carbs&amp;fat increases oxidative stress markers that lead to chronic inflammation and less insulin sensitivity #nutrition

Split squats and step-ups can build structural balance and promote bilateral symmetry for a better squat. Include these in lower body days.
If one leg is stronger than the other it impairs strength&amp;power development in big lifts like the squat as it results in uneven force output

The opposite applies for developing power. switching rapidly from a fast eccentric contraction to a fast concentric is essential for power
For max strength &amp; size control the eccentric (negative) phase of every lift. The increased time under tension will also burn more body fat
Hold the last rep of each set isometrically at the top for 10 seconds. This will ensure that you're strengthening end-range hip extension.

Incorporate lunges to develop structural balance in the quad. They can also decrease patellofemoral pain due to optimal level of muscle...
@sarooshking that's also beneficial but was relating to how to maximize resistance  training results for fat loss.
By doing this your metabolism is elevated to a higher level after exercise and your body burns more calories during the 24hr recovery period
When resistance training for fat loss the focus should be the time under tension. Try using a tempo of 4 seconds down 1 second up.

These fats do not get oxidized unlike olive oil. Use olive oil for low heat cooking or at its best enjoy it fresh#nutrition #bodycomposition
cooking tips for better body composition: at high heat, use coconut oil, red palm oil, butter, and other saturated fats such as beef fat.
overhead BB shrugs use a weight that is 78-80% of your 1rm (10 reps) on a military press and perform 8 reps of shrugs in a controlled tempo
build some trapezius size/strength using overhead barbell shrugs. The movement will strengthen your thoracic erectors and load up the core.

So if your goal is to become more powerful as an athlete don't spend too long being inactive or you will not make any improvements  #fitness
As for elite athletes, research shows that long rest periods results in greater losses in muscular power than strength...
skill-set is retained for much longer periods of time than physiological effects of training. A skill well learnt is usually not forgotten.
rest periods for athletes are necessary for recovery however extended rest periods reduce physical fitness and slow down overall progression
Coffee has the opposite effect, improving sensitivity of cells to insulin due to the high concentration of antioxidants it contains
Pure organic coffee has loads of benefits for strength gains and body composition but avoid energy drinks-they reduce insulin sensitivity

This will recruit 30% more activation in upper chest as to a normal bench press. Egos will have to be left at home as load will be lighter!

This means leaner individuals can eat more nutrients without gaining fat. Try to keep bf low all year round and avoid 'bulking'
So if you have low body fat ur more effective at storing nutrients in the muscle (muscle tissue,glycogen) and less effective storing as fat
The lower your percentage of body fat, the better your body becomes at nutrient partitioning.

The opposite doing cardio before strength will make you weaker as blood pH drops, hampering the bodys ability to recruit max muscle fibers

On your other days a 20min run after strength work at 60-70% (on average 140bps) maximum heart rate will target fat loss.
Interval training after a strength workout will target fat directly as glycogen levels are depleted. Again should be limited to twice a week
Interval training should be limited to twice a wk when performed correctly. On other days maintain heart rate at 60-70% whilst doing cardio.

And as most of you will know, the eccentric movement (negative) should be slow 2-4 seconds for greater hypertrophy #strength #gains
lifters: intramuscular tension is greater when explosive in concentric lifts. So faster you explode when you bench the more hypertrophy
‚Äú@hasanrammo1: Love being a food delivery boy for @FizzAhmed‚Äù amazing gesture
@Beeba_1 good article. The sodium alone in McDonalds foods is very high which can cause heart attacks, strokes, dementia and kidney disease
@troy786 you can't mix skill training (pads) and conditioning. Not effective
Pomegranate will help you get stronger naturally and will also help blood circulation - reduce blood pressure - reduce risk of heart disease
For you lifters and athletes, incorporate superfood - pomegranate into your diet to boost testosterone levels! #strength #superfood
New personal bests on my Olympic snatch today. For all you athletes- great movement to develop functional power! #olympiclifts

Soon it will be time to stack on the lean muscle again with effective clean eating. Ramadan has been a good cleanse! #eatcleanstaylean
The process can help you're skin to produce collagen which will prevent wrinkles. #exercise #stayfit
Exercise will benefit your skin! Toxins will be flushed out, and the improved circulation will bring in more oxygen + nutrients
Consuming foods high in resistance starch  for breakfast will help trigger fat to be used as energy! #tipoftheday goodnight!
Don't be skipping breakfast after Ramadan peeps! Kick start you're day including foods high in resistant starch such as oats and bananas.

8g of protein in a glass of milk of which 6.4g is Casein and remaining is whey. Defeat catabolism! #fasting #Ramadan
Dairy products such as whole milk and cheese are the best choice at suhur as they are rich in Casein protein which will release slower.
To avoid catabolism, consume 3L of water and 1 gram protein per pound in bodyweight from Iftar-suhur. Do not avoid carbohydrates and fats!
Avoid strength training whilst fasting, will lead to dehydration, risk of injury &amp; catabolism. defeats the purpose of 'strength' training.

Also cutting out ur carbs will lower fat burning hormones and cause your body to store energy as fat.
Carbs are stored in the muscles as glycogen, every gram is stored with 2.7g of water. cutting out carbs can drastically effect muscle size
For all who are on zero carb diet you will notice your your muscles appear smaller and flat. Cell volume is diminished when carbs are out

Neither team played great but India were better team by a mile. Misbah continues to play selfish cricket as always.
I got a feeling something controversial gna hapn in the world cup match.
Where's shoaib akhtar :-(
Please pick Shoaib Akhtar v India. He has ability to hurt that strong batting line up. Wahab Riaz is going to get smacked all over the park
Pakistan vs India cricket world cup Semi-final. Doesn't get any bigger than this.
Man City team r top guys. Privilege to meet them esp David Silva. World class & My favourite player in Fifa!  http://plixi.com/p/85868527
Bombing a country to surrender a dictator is not the way to deal with things. Didn't you learn from Iraq or are you doing this on purpose?
@Javedchoksi iv seen some girls head get stuck in between the underground train doors as it closed during school days!
Solis is wack. David haye needs to clean up this division its disgraceful
Good start from pakistan. Disappointed not to see Shoaib Akhtar play against the aussies. Wahab Riaz is not a match winner.. Shoaib is.
Great day to be a couch slouch! Pak v Aus, Match of the day then Klitscho v Solis.. Not forgetting a party in Maddox to end it off ;-)
