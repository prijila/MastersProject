Why not just wait till you have a bunch of inventory for before you announced a release date. #Apple needs to tighten up a little bit.
I'm one of the ones that has to wait till mid Oct/ Nov. They should have known it was going to be a big seller.
#Apple should have made more phones than what they did. Now some people have to wait until mid Oct/Nov to receive their phones.
@RenadaRomain I don't think Ray Rice should have been kicked out the NFL.I think they should have just gave him one year suspension w/o pay.
Hey @RenadaRomain who do you think should be held accountable for the incident in Arizona at the gun range? Her parents or the gun range?

@dallasdaddy39 I know it's been a long time bro. Because if you're picking than damn cowboys shit that's all I got to say.
@dallasdaddy39 So if you run your own football pool. How long has it been since you won the football pool?
@dallasdaddy39 You know what Jason Garrett said. He said sure because he fucking knows bro
@dallasdaddy39 Then the lady said to him how about if you guys go 14-2.But you're two losses, come against the Giants will you be satisfied
@dallasdaddy39 They asked him what kind of team are the Dallas Cowboys. His response was an 8-8 team. No confidence whatsoever
@dallasdaddy39 Ayo didyou watch SportsCenter they had Sunday conversation with Jason Garrett?
@dallasdaddy39 nah you good don't repost that UGLY ass cake. I don't want to throw up today. Lmfao
@dallasdaddy39 I hope you got vacation time at your job. Cuz you're going to be pissed off.
@dallasdaddy39 Week one can't come any sooner.
@dallasdaddy39 How many times a a week do you pick the Giants to win? Don't lie either. Lol
@dallasdaddy39 I see you following my team now. Lol
@dallasdaddy39 yeah I saw that earlier
@RenadaRomain To me I think its jealous  people that can't do it they don't have that type of money and power.I'm fine with it she earned it
@RenadaRomain Oprah can spend her money how she wants.You give the average person a check at the end of the week.
@dallasdaddy39 can't wait in my Bart Scott voice
@dallasdaddy39 Just watched the game from last night.Rueben had one catch that's fine.It was there first preseason game.Cruz looked the same
People don't think that Matt Flynn is going to be a good QB. I like Flynn's game. He will be a good fit with Raiders
@CassiComstock are you guys going to be doing a season 2 of #StreetOutLaws
I hate when athletes say shit on Twitter.Then #ESPN blows it up and they want to be quick to apologize.Why apologize u meant what u said.SMH

@dallasdaddy39 @smoke281 Miles Austin has never been the same after Kim Kardashian.She gave him some of her goodies and fucked him up. Lol
@dallasdaddy39 @smoke281 I think he would be a number two or a three. Dez got that number one locked Miles Austin is injury prone.
@Matt_Barnes22 I agree with you 100% about the nba being soft.I just read the article on the bleacher.
@smoke281 @dallasdaddy39 I'm telling you watch number #82 Ruben Randall in week one. Matter fact you can watch him this Saturday night.
@dallasdaddy39 Ruben Randall is going to be a beast this season. #Giants
@dallasdaddy39 You better watch that boy David Wilson and Ruben Randall. It's about time you're  scouting a real team.
@cdiaz61 @dallasdaddy39 lol
@cdiaz61 @dallasdaddy39 The only thing the cowgirls have going for them is there cheerleaders. All cowgirl fans know it too.
“@cdiaz61: @BLoso24 @dallasdaddy39 pendejo talking outta his ass??” You goddamn right. The cowgirls are a has been team.
@K_Mapp You know that's Giants home away from home. Who got the first win in that stadium when it opened up #Giants or #Cowboys??? I'll wait
@dallasdaddy39 I didn't seen nothing that impressed me. So i'm watching the Home Shopping Network now.
@K_Mapp We'll see if you still talking come week one #Giants vs #Cowgirls
@dallasdaddy39 Oh wait Jerry is the head coach Jason Garrett is his assistant coach. Too many chiefs and not enough Indians
@dallasdaddy39 fuck Jerry's words. Jerry is not the QB, RB,WR, DB, LB Jerry ain't shit ALL MOUTH
@K_Mapp thanks but the truth hurts you know it deep down inside.
The cowgirls are going to use a 3 running back system this season.So they can keep the ball out of Tony Homo hands.#RealTalk @dallasdaddy39
RT @JLum320: I have nothing against the #Dolphins, but no one is shook over a mint green fish charging at them. Toughen up those uniforms #…
“@dallasdaddy39: "@BLoso24: @dallasdaddy39 oh shit cowgirl down" he good #Knwdat” You better hope so
@dallasdaddy39 oh shit cowgirl down
@dallasdaddy39 Well let him meet the front defensive line of the New York Giants. Pooowwwww
@dallasdaddy39 Not on it never was #BelieveThat
@dallasdaddy39 Tanner looked good right there on that run.
@dallasdaddy39 You know I have to call Tom Coughlin up after the game.So we can go over what I saw in the game. Lol
@dallasdaddy39 He'll be in on the next series?
#Dolphins can't hold on to the ball tonight
Ayo @dallasdaddy39 That running back that started for Dallas he looked pretty good.
Ayo @dallasdaddy39 cowgirls are winning.They can be in soul possession of first place if they win this game tonight.Oh it's only preseason
“@Professor_Millz: 2 guns was amazing I highly recommend that everybody go see it” yeah I need to go see it

“@CraigHasan: #LakerFam, how long (or short) till Dwight wants McHale fired?” B By the All-Star break
“@Ciannedc: @BLoso24 so odom is out?” I haven't heard anything on Odom. There's still one roster spot available
@Ciannedc I think there's one spot let and Wes Johnson got a 1 year deal from the lakers
I think the #Lakers have one more roster spot to fill. I think they should look at Brandon Wright center played with the Mavs last season.
Or maybe the #Lakers can look at K-Mart very good defender,Ivan Johnson he's a good rebounder,Byron Mullens has some athleticism to his game
I think @MettaWorldPeace should work as a #NBA commentator for #TNT , #ESPN, or #Lakers

@CraigHasan cool cool
@CraigHasan oh my bad. Yeah just keep it
“@CraigHasan: @BLoso24 I won't” won't what?
RT @LakersLALTalk: Lakers top free agents for next season John Wall and Carmelo Anthony? I like it
“@LakersLALTalk: Lakers top free agents for next season John Wall and Carmelo Anthony? I like it”They better #FireD'Antoni if they want Melo
“@CraigHasan: #LakerFam, should I burn my Howard jersey?” No
“@TheBigGuy16: @BLoso24 that's 6 bud” that's why I put OR
@_DennyBoo shit on level 29 for about 2 months now
PG,Stephen Curry SG,Klay Thompson or ,Andre Iguodala SF Harrison Barnes, PF David Lee, C  Andrew Bogut that's a good starting 5
“@_DennyBoo: This #CandyCrush level is getting on my nerves.” What level are you on?
“@its_LAKERTIME: The Lakers need to get Ariza back, he was a beast” hell yeah!
I like the Dwight,I just don't think Dwight will win a championship with the Rockets. He would have had a better shot with the Warriors
One of the reasons he didn't want to stay with LA he wants a chance to win and have his own team. That's James Harden team anyway.
By Kobe unfollowing Dwight it just shows that Kobe is upset. Don't worry about Kobe it's his loss.
Dwight will still be OPTION number two (2) in Houston.I think the Rockets make it to the second round in the playoffs and get knocked out.
#ESPN talking about how good the Rockets will be with Dwight.The team that they need to talking about are the Warriors with Andre Iguodala
RT @_____0__o______: I support Dwights decision. Shit happens. Now can we please get some players.
“@Atraingr8: Haha Baby Melo tweeted #StayD12

Look at my last tweet I mean his last tweet lol” who Melo's tweet?
So Dwight gains 20k followers in an hour on twitter.So if he leaves LA he will lose the 20k followers plus respect from the 4 other teams✌
“@blue5538: I will save my comments until after D12 decides!!” That makes the two of us.
“@3DDIE_Lakers24: I would be shocked if Dwight says he's staying in LA! Shocked!!!” Wordup!!!!
“@mightyfar: Hollywood or Houston? @DwightHoward” Don't forget the Bay
I hope the #Lakers just S&amp;T Dwight already. I want him to sign with the Lakers but its obvious that he doesn't want to. It's his loss
@MySportsLegion Boozer &amp; Butler is a better deal for the #Bulls. Then the Bulls would just have to find another small forward
@_DennyBoo You have to take it easy there 🍺
“@MySportsLegion: Blazers have offered LaMarcus Aldridge to the Bulls for Joakim Noah and Jimmy Butler.” I wouldn't do it if I'm the #Bulls
@_DennyBoo  Oh I thought you saw the lights in person
“@_DennyBoo: Baby let me love you down!!!!!” Okay
“@_DennyBoo: The Empire State Building looks amazing with those lights!” Take a picture of it. I can't see it from here 😋
@BrianaBball And if he made his decision at midnight and it didn't go your way how piss would you be?
“@BrianaBball: I really wish Dwight will make his decision at mid-night just so we can get this over with!”You want him to stay with the LA?
“@808Rich: If we do sign &amp; trade w/ GSW who my #LakerFam rather have Klay or Barnes? I like Klay...” Klay Thomson
@LakersLDYnasty I think he knows already but he will wait till after the weekend. That's my guess
@SouthBayRaised @808Rich Yeah Paul George showed a lot of leadership this past season. I like his game
@808Rich @SouthBayRaised With Kobe teaching Melo leadership and showing him that it's not all about him who knows how it would work out.
@SouthBayRaised @808Rich All man that would be a really good team. How about Dwight, Melo and Rondo? Once Rondo becomes a free agent
“@MAMBAOUT_24: @BLoso24 he is gone. I think!” I'm with you on that I think the same thing
@SouthBayRaised @808Rich Yeah I agree with you. I wouldn't mind Bron coming but I think it would be easier to lure Melo to the Lakers.
@JRudolphSports Where do you think Dwight will end up signing?
Who really thinks that Dwight is going to sign with the #Lakers??????
I know it's still a year away but for the 2014 #freeagent. I think Kobe can get Melo in a #Lakers uniform. #JustSaying
Congratulations to Earl Clark
Today Earl Clark reports will sign with the #Cavs. Will Dwight follow him &amp; sign elsewhere. I blame D'Antoni #FireD'Antoni
@3DDIE_Lakers24  Earl Clark is going to the cavs for 2 years
@GinaMuscato Okay thanks :(
I think even if D12 goes to the Rockets. They won't win championship they have no PG. I hope they don't think Lin can play the point
@EmceeUspire I was saying the bulls let another player go along Carlos Boozer for Smith
@EmceeUspire Even if they amnesty Carlos Boozer and let someone else go?
@DEIDRICHGOOLEY Yeah I think he is going to the bucks. Bullshit
I think the #ChicagoBulls should amnesty Carlos Boozer and go after Josh Smith. I just think that Carlos Boozer is overrated.
If Earl Clark doesn't want to sign back with the #Lakers let him go he didn't show up down the stretch to end the season.
I wish the #Lakers would look at OJ Mayo.
I don't think Dwight will know where he wants to go by Friday. He will need more time I think
I say before the NBA All-Star break you will see a lot of this #FireD'Antoni . Shit I wish they would do it now.
I wish it was Friday tomorrow. So we can hopefully get some answers from Dwight on where he wants to go.
If Dwight &amp; Josh Smith were to go to the Rockets. How good would they really big? If the Rockets were to pull it off.
If Dwight decides not to re-sign with the Lakers. It will be a LONG season for the #Lakers.
RT @Gaby_La24: :))) RT @MLB: What a milestone! @CC_Sabathia records win No. CC. http://t.co/mIgfP1mXGW
RT @mothugsoldier: I do think Kobe should fall back tho.. D12 should be the #1 option. 4thQ still belongs To 24 cause of D12 FT shooting. B…
Yes
@Ayoo_Sheed He's really underrated I think so. Yes agree with you with a good team he can be really good
@Ayoo_Sheed  I hope Chris Copeland ends up signing with the Lakers.
So CP3 re-signs back with the #Clippers . I didn't no that they had a #CLIPPERNATION. #ImJustSaying keep it real CP3
It looks like the #Pelicans  are trying to make some moves in #NBAFreeAgency. They are expected to talk with Tyreke Evans tonight
Hour an half until #NBAFreeAgency starts
I'll put some of that R.Kelly classic music on with Meagan Good sexy ass

@smoke281 lol
@smoke281 You're not watching it?
Watching the #BETAwards
Once it's the Lakers turn to talk with Dwight Howard.They should bring in Ice Cube,Snoop Lion,Adam Sandler &amp; Jack Nicholson
“@JabariDavisNBA: Red beans and smoked turkey wings...don't mind if I do.” Enjoy
#Lakers management,are going to take a change on losing D12 by keeping D'Antoni.I hope they know what there doing.Just keep putting signs up
“@sdkjq: If Rondo goes to Dallas, I think Dwight will too” is that the new rumor about Rondo?
#Lakers need to get rid of the coach..IF they want D12 that bad fire D'Antoni and stop putting up signs about #StayD12.JUST FIRE D'ANTONI
If Dwight is the future of the #Lakers.Why is MDA still apart of this team?His system isn't fit for a center.I say get rid of MDA.
As much as I want Dwight to stay with the #Lakers.The team is too old they can't win now.
Kobe can return in October November December who knows. It all depends on his rehab. I know I can't wait to see him play again.
But once he returns will it be too late for Lakers to make a playoff run. If he does come back say late December early January.
With all the crazy signs that the #Lakers are putting up relating to Dwight.I feel like the Lakers are just going to push him away. PATHETIC
Lakers should look for a new head coach before the season begins.Here are some good coaches George Karl, Jeff Van Gundy, Larry Brown
“@DR_LAKERS: How in the world is MDA still our coach?” Cuz Mitch has been smoking some of the snoop lion weed
How many ESPN, TNT or ABC game will the #Celtics have this season? I know they will have Brooklyn Nets vs Boston game on TV.
Other than that I think the bobcats will get more TV time this year than the Celtics will.
Welcome to the #Lakers Ryan Kelly. Lets give the man a shot he has a jumper.
#Lakers pick next #48 about damn time
“@LALMel2412: Rondo good as gone now though. Where y'all sending him @Celtics?” Hopefully to the staple center with the Purple &amp; gold
If #Boston is rebuilding. Then the #Lakers should get another team involved with a trade to bring Rondo to the #Lakers
Hey Celtics Pau Gasol for Rondo you need a big man. #Lakers
“@True2_Love: Rondo needs to leave now” To the Lakers
Everything is falling apart for the city of Boston. Just sad
I think if the #BrooklynNets stay healthy this upcoming season. They have a shot to be anyone in the East.
“@trill_boss_chic: Stern is lo-key getting annoyed by the boo's 😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭” He has to you can see it in his face. Lol
Gianni Antetokunmop needs a protein bar once he gets to Milwaukee
“@DR_LAKERS: everyone making moves except my fucking lakers SMFH” Move the head coach (Mike D'Antoni)
Hey Kelly Olynyk with your first NBA check go get your teeth fixed my dude.
Noel will have to postpone that block party he was talking about
If D12 ends up signing with Dallas or Houston. I don't blame no one but the @Lakers management. The reason is Mike D'Antoni.
Time to watch the NBA draft preview

In the #NBAFinals all the pressure is on the #Spurs. Cuz they have their fans plus the other 28 #NBATeams fans rooting for them.
A lot of us hate the heat but you have to give them credit. They're going to their third straight nba finals.On that note Let's go #Spurs!!!

#Pacers need to start the second half  strong. Like @SHAQ said @ halftime. The Pacers need to do what got them here. #NBAPlayoffs
Lmfaooo! @SHAQ just call Charles Barkley butt face
@Lakers305 I say Lebron under 25 shots for game 7.
I agree with @Shaq that Roy Hibbert is the best big man in the league.
There will be a game 7 #NBAPlayoffs
The #Pacers need to feed Roy Hibbert the ball down low. It worked in the 1st,2nd and 3rd quarter. #NBAPlayoffs
The #Pacers just need to play smart in the 4th quarter and we will have a game 7
Stand VanGundy do you think Dwight could have done that move that Roy Hibbert just did.
LeBron will get a bill in the mail $10,000 fine. #NBAPlayoffs
Lol Reggie Miller just said the Miami Cavaliers
“@RamneetSingh24: @SHAQ Kenny is a close Dukie” You won the hundred dollars
Stop showing off Paul George get back on defense. #NBAPlayoffs
All the #Pacers need to do is get the ball to David West or Roy Hibbert. The heat don't have the answer for either guy.
The #Pacers need George Hill to bring the ball up not Paul George.

“@PRIMO_LAKER69: Heat fans is past your bed time...” They all went to bed once Lebron fouled out
The way Roy Hibbert is playing not just in this series but the playoffs this year.I think Hibbert is the best center in the #NBA
“@Eman_Lakers24: Wade got caught looking for Lebron!” Lmfao
Wade's knees is so bad he didn't even notice that he travels. #NBAPlayoffs
All Indiana has to do is playing good defense no fouls and don't give up a three pointer.Simple as that. #NBAPlayoffs
LeBron needs to put his warm-up suit back on he isn't coming back in this game. #NBAPlayoffs

It was a really good game Pacers vs Heat tho
@Mario_be_real yup
@Mario_be_real I think the pacers coach did the same thing in the 4th quarter. Put Hibbert on the bench and they attacked the basket.
The Pacers know that they can beat the heat. They might've lost tonight but they'll come back stronger in game 2.
I still got the Pacers in 7games
Oh boy get ready for SportsCenter everyone.

If you watch after every shot Miami takes their player is falling on the floor trying to get a foul call.
Bosh after the game is going to go up to Coles and tell him to grab his shit too. Lol
The Miami Heat are fucking cheaters.
Now the ref are helping the heat giving  them every call. Smdh

@mannye8 he doesn't have to rush back.He is going to be 35 years old why rush him back.I'm just saying it as a business move for the Lakers.
Then the Lakers can go after Chris Paul once they amnesty Kobe contract. Who disagrees with me??????
#Lakers should amnesty Kobe's contract.That will save the Lakers $30 million.Then he doesn't have to rush back LA can pick him up in 2014.
After this season is over for the #Bulls. They need to find a way to get rid of Carlos Boozer. He is trash
Happy Mother's Day to all
LeBron is building a new house in Chicago with all those bricks he's throwing up in the fourth quarter
Damn 5-9' Nate with the block on Lebron
Chicago needs to bring back Nate Robinson
@Jay_Laker agree 100%
“@Jay_Laker: Bad ejection. Very bad ejection” Yes it was I agree with you. That's the second elbow Lebron has thrown in this series
And the NBA isn't fixed
They should both get ejected
Noah got a technical when Lebron  endowed him in game 2
Chris Andersen should get a technical he kicked his leg.
RT @trill_boss_chic: BEAT THE HEAT!!! GO BULLS!
“@LakeShOwQueen: If @MettaWorldPeace did what CHALMERS did he woulda been suspended 8 games” TRUE
: Lesson 1: Don't get LeBron angry.” Lesson 2: get off LeBron's dick @espn
LeBron is a good player but he is a 265 pound piece of shit
The referees want Miami to win this game bullshit
Let's go #Bulls
Everyone is saying the #heat loss cuz of the long layoff. Well the #Spurs had a long layoff they didn't lose.
The #Spurs are older and played a younger #warriors team. The #heat are healthy and played a banged up #bulls team
“@NOTSportsCenter: BREAKING: David Stern has fired the ref crew from Game 1 for violating #NBA policy and allowing the #Heat to lose” lmao
Heat in 5, Knicks in 6, Grizzlies in 6, GS in 7 #NBAPlayoffs
My two picks for today's #NBAPlayoff games are Grizzlies &amp; Knicks
If CP3 leaves the clippers which team do you think he will end up with?
@DionN78 oh
@DionN78 What channel?
@DionN78 yo what's going on
The clippers &amp; Billy Crystal are gone fishing http://t.co/InnVi5F3c0
I knew this game was going to be good clippers vs Grizzlies
Melo should not be handling the ball for the Knicks.
The Knicks always got to make it interesting. Smdh
Knicks need to play smart and don't let Boston get in there heads and pick up stupid T's
I'm going with the Grizzlies to beat the Clippers
That Clippers vs Grizzlies game should be good
It's starting to fall apart for Boston
When the Knicks are hitting there 3's they are dangerous
Boston isn't going to go away easy veteran team. Knicks need to put together a good run to end the 3rd quarter
Bullshit call all ball
If Boston is going to leave Pablo open take the shot
The 2nd half of #Bos vs #NYK will be good
“@_____0__o______: **Waiting for a Celtic fan to throw Cheerios at Melo**” lmfao
Knicks need to keep hitting there shots in the 2nd half. Cuz Boston will come out for the last 24 minutes of the 2nd half with energy.
“@_____0__o______: Jason Terry like that roach that you cant kill.” Word
Boston is getting under the Knicks skin @ the end of the game.That can be a good move for Boston or it can be a bad move.See what happens #6
J.Terry shut the fuck up big head
The Knicks lost this game cuz Woodson doesn't know how to use his bench. Yeah Melo &amp;J.R were off tonight but no excuse. Game 6
@Ayoo_Sheed Now only down five. this is where they need to play tough defense
@Ayoo_Sheed Yeah I feel you
If the Knicks keep letting the Celtics stick around in this series. It is going to bite them in their ass. Remember Red Sox vs Yankees
“@Ayoo_Sheed: Melo don't play no defense” Did you just realize that now
Without Felton the Knicks would be down a lot more
“@NikkiNic9384: Sit ur ass down JR. U should put as much energy into playing well as u do complaining and talking shit.” SO TRUE
@Kimberley818 I wonder why Woodson hasn't played him he can hit the three
@Kimberley818 Then they need to put in Chris Copeland
Woodson needs to take J.R.Smith out and talk to him Knicks
@Bon3Z4ReaL thanks!
The Knicks need to put in discount double check. Cuz J.Kidd isn't  doing anything
@Bon3Z4ReaL Hey I am rooting for the Knicks in this series. But they are playing like shit
@Bon3Z4ReaL That was a low blow
@Bon3Z4ReaL lol
Hey Knicks fans can you say game 6
J.R. Smith is hurting the Knicks as well 0-10 smh
Woodson needs to take J. Kidd out the game .All he is doing is hurting the Knicks
I'm going with the Grizzlies tonight
@LakersReporter Lakers need someone like Jarrett Jack to come off the bench.Lakers need help in other positions but Jack would be a good fit
@Mario_be_real that sucks
@AlisWorld_ that's what's up Lakers all day
@Lakerella nah Durant should just call A-Rod for some HGH 
@AlisWorld_ Good reply back
If D12 re-signs with the lakers in the summer. Between Kobe &amp; D12 next season that's 50 million. In just two players.
@Mario_be_real I want Dwight to re-sign with the Lakers.But look what the heat did Lebron,Wade &amp; Bosh all took less $ to play together.
@Mario_be_real Dwight wants a ring.Lakers right now aren't built to win a champions.I don't think they will be next season.Hope I'm worry
“@Mario_be_real: #KeepDwightInLA ” Yes Sir
With my #Lakers out the playoffs.I'm going with the #Knicks to win it all.But I'm still a #Lakers fan first.I like to see Melo get a ring.
Why would Dwight really want to come back to play for the #Lakers next season? This team is too old to win a championship.TIME TO REBUILD
Don't get me wrong I want Dwight to re-sign with LA though. But we have to get young talent around him good talent at that.
@JenYjUiice yeah they have hot dogs and other foods. I go every time I'm up in Orlando.
Why is that breaking news that the Jets release Tim Tebow. Like we all didn't know that it was going to happen. Step it up #SportsCenter
@JenYjUiice Columbian burger 11301 S.orange blossom trail suite 102 Orlando. The place is called Chalo's. I know I am late on the tweet but.
Popovich on the injury-riddled Lakers: "Obviously it wasn't a fair fight."” @Enow32
You know Shaq is going to get on McGee at halftime after that Bogut dunk
The Nuggets vs Warriors &amp; Grizzlies vs Clippers are the best first around playoff series.
Dammmnnnnn Bogut
@RealFLYTYE Yes I forgot about him
Fuck is it football season yet? My #Lakers are done for the summer
Remember when the Lakers crowd looked like the Golden State crowd dose now. Wow! The good old days #LakersNation
The 2 players that I would love for the #Lakers to go after are Andre Iguodala and Chris Paul.I know it won't happen but it would be nice.
Will this #Lakers team look different at the start of next season?
It's no secret that the #Lakers need to get a better bench and younger athletic players.
#Lakers need to cut or trade Devin Ebanks,Darris Morris,Robert Sacre,Chris Duhon n Andrew Goudelock. See what they can get for Gasol n MWP.
Players #Lakers should look @ this summer.Devin Harris PG,Nick Young SG,Wesley Johnson SF,Dante Cunningham PF,Brandon Wright C bench players
Players #Lakers should look at this summer.Nate Robinson PG,Darren Collison PG,Jarrett Jack PG,D.J. Augustin,Jerryd Bayless PG.Bench players
“@nataliee_n: I'm just going to stay in my seat until the Staples Center staff kicks me out.”lmfaoooo
The five players on the court for the Lakers looks like the D League players
“@soblessed1129: I don't,I respect him but I think.he feels the lakers spirit” I respect him to I'm just saying
@l1teral He needs to develop a shot jumper something
@l1teral No I'm not kidding. He isn't a player that you can go to every time on offense. He has one move that's it no jumper (dunk)
RT @_Nomiahkey: @DwightHoward all day!!!!...
@Enow32 We had no one playing everyone's hurt. The Spurs wouldn't beat the Lakers if Parker, Ginobili and Duncan was out. Real talk
I don't think Dwight is a max player. I still want him in a Lakers uniform
Jim Buss &amp; Mitch Kupchak are running the Lakers more like ruining the #Lakers.
@SouthBayRaised  hope not
@Diva4ya10 @beautinbrains24 I know he has one year left on the contract but still needs to do something 30 million next season
@Diva4ya10 @beautinbrains24 Kobe is my favorite player but I think he needs to restructure his contract to get some better players there.
@BeautiNBrains24 @diva4ya10 Yes I agree with that to they won't win then. They need to put their egos aside and just do it that way.
@SouthBayRaised Yeah just watching it to. He was pissed about something. He  probably told him don't touch my ass motherfucker
Damn Lakers still down 20 points. Make some effort fuck
“@SouthBayRaised: Holy fuck. Just saw the interaction between Dwight and Mitch. Man that's horrible.” What do you think he said?
Good shit Lil mamba
@Diva4ya10 @beautinbrains24 I'm not a heat fan but the #Lakers should do what the heat did.Everyone took less $$ to win a championship.
“@lovely_lkrgirl: I hope Dwight told Mitch to fire MDA” Yeah I wonder what did he say. He was yelling something at Mitch.
@BeautiNBrains24 They need to make a lot of changes this off season
@_DennyBoo He got 2 technicals
“@BeautiNBrains24: Is that the last time we will see Dwight in a Lakers uniform?” I really hope not but you never know.Lakers are to old
Kobe should have came out when Dwight was still playing. It just makes it seem like Kobe doesn't want to be in the lock room with Dwight.
The Mamba is in the build
Wow! Is this Dwight's last game as a Laker? I hope not
@Lakerella Bring him and throw him off the boat with no life jacket
What a terrible possession by the Lakers. WTF
About time Clark
D.Morris is a waste of roster space. Lakers
#LakersNation do you think Jack will stay for the whole game?
Lat's go Lakers
@DionN78 She's like a dolphin. Brandie is showing her how to swim this summer.
@DionN78 she's good taking a nap. Her Lil ass was in the pool earlier this morning
@DionN78 Yeah and the Celtics are playing like they need it to. The next Arflack
@DionN78 And the Celtics have Pierce and KG on the bench with three fouls.
@DionN78 That's what the Knicks should have done to put Pierce on the bench with KG.Cuz Pearce is on fire.U put him on the bench with three
@DionN78 Celtics have a lot of energy.Knicks should have tried &amp; got Pierces his 3rd foul they aren't playing smart.Pierces is killing them
@DionN78 lol
Knicks need to play Chris Copeland
Melo needs to post up Paul Pierce try and get Pierce with his third foul.
Ayo @Ayoo_Sheed  your Knicks need to play Chris Copeland. Melo needs help out there. Copeland will spread the floor.
Boston has come out with a lot of energy.Do you think they will be able to play like this the whole game?
Omg get out of here Nate! That was a good shot the dude is on fire.
Is little Nate going to get a game winner or second overtime?
Little Nate Robinson has more points off the bench. Then the Lakers bench scored in three playoff games. Smdh
@Soxdontmatch They don't have a running back better than Eddie Lacy
@Soxdontmatch Oh you was talking about the 49ers
“@Soxdontmatch: don't they have enough??” Who you talking about??
Oh well for that Packers just traded their pick
The Green Bay Packers need a running back. I think they should go after Eddie Lacy now.
Watch the patriots will go and get Eddie Lacy now
@BDiesel37 Well that didn't work out Defense of tackle isn't bad though
Giants need to pick up Eddie Lacy now
If the Steelers don't get Eddie Lacy. The Giants should go after him even though the Giants need to work on their defense
The cowgirls should pick a punter. Because that's all there going to be doing 3 &amp; out.
@Andresalza12 Nah the falls view
@Andresalza12 Keep dreaming bro keep dreaming
Geno Smith has left the building 
@Andresalza12 They can use E-Ville high school football field. Lmfao
@Andresalza12 The Jets need more than him. They first need to move out of the Giants Stadium and get their own damn stadium.
@Andresalza12 fuck the Jets
@Andresalza12 lol
Geno Smith needs to make a song called (I waiting)
Geno Smith better go get himself a Snickers bar. It's going to be a while
Packers should go after Eddie Lacey running back.
I think ESPN feels bad for Geno Smith.On every commercial break they show Geno Smith highlights.That's not getting him drafted any faster.
@Hey_its_Don He's a game changer
I want the #Giants next pick to be the honey badger.
Justin Pugh to the #Giants from #Syracuse
I don't want Manti Te'o to go the the #Giants
Gino Smith you can stay in that seat because the #Giants aren't going to pick you.
I like Eric Reid safety
Two more picks then its the #Giants  turn
Wow bills
Geno Smith was 0-3 vs Ryan Nassib
@Ayoo_Sheed Yeah he might as will just come back tomorrow
RT @PRIMO_LAKER69: I heard Manti Te'o is at the hotel room with his girlfriend watching the #nfldraft
“@PRIMO_LAKER69: I heard Manti Te'o is at the hotel room with his girlfriend watching the #nfldraft” lmfao you crazy
“@Ayoo_Sheed: No quarterbacks yet...” Ryan Nassib will be the first qb picked. Poor Geno
Jets should have drafted Manti Te'o to add to their circus
RT @Ayoo_Sheed: Lmaoooo jet fans enjoy the circus!
Let's go pick #19 #Giants
Poor Geno Smith look at him he is playing doodle jump.
Dee Milliner with his first check needs should go get his teeth fixed.
Jets should go after Tyler Eifert tight end
That was a good pick for the #Rams Tavon Austin
I like Tavon Austin
Ezekiel Ansah said he will be the LeBron James for the #Detroitlions
“@Nevers_Failures: Barry Sanders is the only reason the Lions have ever been relevant” That is very true
“@RobinS_Thick: It's time we make this thing official 😏” That's what I've been waiting for you to say.
Barry Sanders at the #NFLdraft2013
@Lakers305 Damn that was your boy
@Lakers305 cool
@Lakers305 Who do you want your team to pick? You're an Eagles fan correct?
@DionN78 enjoy bro
If Tyrann Mathieu is still on the board by the third round. I think the #Giants should go after him. #Gamechanger
#Lakers need to tell D'Antoni to take a bus back to LA.
@Goddard246 That's what the Lakers need and younger players
@kobebryant you can tweet now this game is over.
@Goddard246 Jeff Van Gundy or Nate McMillan
“@SouthBayRaised: I wonder what @kobebryant is thinking.”He might have about100 tweets saved ready to hit the send button after game is done
Damn now  Blake is on the bench rubbing his leg. The #Lakers are falling apart. Wtf
Good defense Pau you fucking asshole
Dwight needs to play smarter. Lakers
Nash is going to need some ice after this game. He is skipping up the court he looks bad.
If this is what #LakersNation has to look forward to once Kobe retires. It will be sad to watch it.
@BeautiNBrains24 You're not alone
#Lakers can you please send Morris back to the D league and leave him there or get rid of him. 
@BeautiNBrains24 This is just ridiculous
I wish the #Lakers had that PG from the state farm commercials.
Good D Blake
They need to take Nash out he is hurt. #Lakers
There goes Tony Parker again attacking the rim. Smfh
#Lakers need a new PG  #RealTalk
The #Lakers need a PG that can ATTACK the rim.
Morris needs to do the same thing that Tony Parker is doing attack the basket. He has the speed. Lakers
Nice move Dwight and one
Let's go Lakers!!! We need this win
@Tweets_By_Pat Don't forget about Nash Lakers stuck with his old ass for two more years. Smdh
@CnashNash oh ok lol
@TravisTheFlyGuy Kobe Bryant and  C.Anthony
@Tweets_By_Pat Cuz Nash is D'Antoni's bitch
“@_lostntheworld: 😂😭 James Harden aint never lose his baby teeth, his adult teeth just told them bitches "move over"”” Lmfao good one
How crazy would that be if the Bucks wear to upset the Heat.In my opinion that would be the biggest upset in all of sports.
The heats new name should be #FlopHeat
Lakers need to win game 2 #LakersVsSpurs
Why are the Lakers still fouling
Tony Parker just picked up his first foul of the game. Bullshit
Lakers need to hit there FT
Dwight needs to play smart D
C'mon Lakers only down 4 points
About time MWP
Darelle Revis just robbed the Bucs 6 years $96 million smdh
MWP needs to stop taking 3's with 20 sec left on the shot clock
Lakers need to attack the rim
I think the ref are spurs fans
Lakers need to win the 3rd and 4th quarter. Halftime Lakers down 45-37
Morris needs to just shoot the damn ball
In your face Pop
Here we go hit your FT Dwight
Morris your an asshole rap him up
Wow lucky 3 by Blake
Gasol needs to follow his damn shots the defenders need to close in on the three point shooters. C'mon Lakers
Give them a T
Nice pass Gasol to Dwight for the slam
Lakers are getting ALL the bad calls
Jamison is getting fouled every play down low. Lakers
I think Blake will defend Parker better then Nash in this series. LAL vs SAS
The Lakers are settling for too many jumpers
Ok Dwight I see
Pau get in Duncan's face
Nice give and go
Good shot Pau
Give the ball to Dwight in the post Lakers
Nash
It's game time LAL vs SAS game 1. Let's go #Lakers!
@CraigHasan an other guy I think who would be a good fit is Andre Iguodala  at the SF
@CraigHasan then you can have cp3 and Dwight 2 superstars. Just get some good plays around them.
@CraigHasan No Nash to come off the bench to help the bench out.
@CraigHasan I know the Lakers won't do it but it would be nice
@CraigHasan If he said to the clippers after this season.That he will not be resign with them.I would love for the Lakers to go after him
@CraigHasan he can leave the clippers after this season right?
@CraigHasan Yes I agree with you 100% on that
@CraigHasan they are very lucky
Damn I wish CP3 was a #Laker agree or disagree??????
@roxieeroc *beat
RT @Mario_be_real: Flop City
That was a good foul call on Blake
@RoxieeRoc Well Brandon Jennings from the Bucks said that they will be Miami in six games.  Lol
@RoxieeRoc They sure do maybe in the Eastern conference finals they will get challenged.
“@RoxieeRoc: @BLoso24 what about Miami?”winner from Nets vs Bulls
“@_DennyBoo: I'd like to undress a guy with v cut abs. It would motivate me more on what to do once he's naked. Hahaha.” You little freak
“@RoxieeRoc: If clippers win this series who they play next ?” Winner from OKC  vs Rockets series
@DionN78 yeah I'm going to watching that
@DionN78 damn dude talking shit about Jon Bones Jones.
@DionN78 Do you think he still would have proposed if he would've got knocked out? (Henderson)
@DionN78 that sucks
Why isn't Jay Z wearing his wedding ring
@DionN78 I wasn't going for either one of them either. I just want to see a good fight. I don't know who the hell they are.
@DionN78 I thought it was Troy Polamalu at first. Lol
@DionN78 But I think he might win this fight the do with the long hair
@DionN78 The dude with the long hair needs to cut that shit. He keeps getting in his way
@DionN78 yeah really good
@DionN78 nothing watching the fight
Ayo @DionN78 are you watching the #UFConFOX ?
@Sportsluvr Yes I would do the same thing too. If they say one hit per person. Just keep pinching and say you lost count.
@Sportsluvr That sounds good but I don't think he would last week.
“@Kimberley818: Just saw Olympus Has Fallen 👍” Yes it was really good
That was a really good game to end the regular season. It's playoffs time now #LakersNation
I like how the #Lakers NEVER gave up and got back in the game, and then won the game.
Buen juego @paugasol y Dwight jugó como animales
#Lakers win  now the Lakers are the 7 seed in the playoffs. #Lakers vs Spurs  round 1

Good game @DwightHoward straight #BEASTMODE  in the second half. #Lakers

#Whitechocolate Steve Blake #Lakers
“@SerenaWinters: So this Steve Blake is for real, guys.” yeah make Nash come off the bench then
15-4 run by the #Lakers

If the Lakers play it right they can live at the FT line for the rest of the game. They have to hit  there free throws though.
Lakers down 2 now
Hit your FT Lakers
“@IBCarlosLOve: I hate working.” We all do bro
Damn with 8:55 left in the game the Rockets are over the limit with fouls

Good basket MWP and was fouled
About time MWP for 3
Lakers starting slow
I wish the Lakers would have played first. They are playing like they don't care they are in the playoffs already. Smdh
In the second half Lakers need to NOT take so many 3's especially if they're not falling . Play smart in the second half LA.
Dwight needs to be a BEAST in the second half. Lakers
Halftime Lakers down 50-44
Lakers are 6-18 from three pointers in the first half. SMDH
Meeks needs to learn how to finish the fast break
Lakers need to score on Rockets missed basket
Harden ran into a wall
Don't give that stupid look Harden that was a cheep foul just like your fouls calls
C'mon bullshit, Harden lost the ball
Gasol that's all day
To me Blake would be the only Laker I want shooting the three
The Lakers should have picked up Delante West for the rest of the season. Once Kobe went down with his injury
Lakers can't get back on defense for shit
Nice boxout Lakers
End of the first Lakers down 24-21
Harding gets the little bullshit tickie tack fouls

Meeks dialing in from long distance #Lakers
#Lakers you have to talk on defense

Going to the beach today BBQ time with the fellas
@Ayoo_Sheed lol
@Ayoo_Sheed Yeah but if that was Phil he would have taken Kobe out D'Antoni is scared.Take him out for five minutes to get checked out.
@Ayoo_Sheed You can blame Kobe for not wanting to come out the game but that is just the warrior he is.
@Ayoo_Sheed I put the blame more on D'Antoni for not taking him out the game to get looked at he's the head coach he makes the decisions.
@Ayoo_Sheed Dantoni has been playing him way too many minutes down the stretch. He played 45 minutes last night prior to getting hurt.
@Ayoo_Sheed I think they called a timeout that's the only time that Kobe  got looked at
@Ayoo_Sheed nah he had hurt his knee and ankle prior to taring his Achilles. He never came out the game.That dude is a warrior. (Kobe)
@Ayoo_Sheed Yeah but he wouldn't go out. If it wasn't for his Achilles.

Oh yeah and the Lakers can get rid of coach D'Antoni as well

Copeland is on  from beyond the arc
Knicks should win this game and win the points in the paint as well as the three point shots
Like I said no big man down low for Oklahoma it's killing them
Collison can't guard Copeland when he's at the three point line. Copeland will blow right by him every time
Knicks can't give Oklahoma them second shot opportunities
That was a late foul call for Durant
Knicks are playing with Copeland at the center position. That is messing up Oklahoma's defense.
Because then there big have to step out and guard the three point shots to.
Copland will spread the floor for the Knicks
Damn Jason Kidd is on  from three point land Knicks
Nice spin by Chandler Knicks

Lakers must win the 3rd quarter. If they want to win this game. They can't come out flat to began the 2nd half.
Lakers must play like they are down by 20 pts. They need to go on a run during the 3rd quarter.
Lakers need to protect the ball on offense no turnovers.

Nuggets winning streak should be the talk of the #NBA 13in a row.How many all stars does the Nuggets have on there roster this year? ZERO!!!
Of course there is a mismatch every time the heat play. It's eight vs five.
“@Ayoo_Sheed: Nba needs the heat to be good” You are 100% correct #sportscenter has LeBron's dick all in there mouth.
The referees just gave the heat another win. SMDH!!!!!
A fan just ran out on the court of Miami vs Cleveland game. It look like the fan went towards LeBron. Lol!
“@Bklyn57: #NCAA Winner of LIU (20-13) vs JMS (22-14) Plays Indiana (27-6) on Friday” Yes
Miami's  23game winning streak doesn't impress me.Nuggets 13 game winning streak impresses me more.Heat have the big 3, Nuggets have ballers
@sahny3280 @Mackadosious suckafree_lif33 intensity03 http://t.co/g0DsPoHusS

@CLOSSTHEKING @ridiculous252 I don't think Gasol should be shooting threes anyway
@CLOSSTHEKING @ridiculous252 Yes but what are you going to do posted up two players on opposite side.His coaching style is a up temple style
I want #PR to beat #DR in the baseball world classic game. So I can go watch them in Miami on Tuesday. Let's go #PR!!!!
@CLOSSTHEKING @ridiculous252 Yes I agree with you on that. I just don't like him as a coach.
Let's go PR!!!
@Ridiculous252 @closstheking It's the players the coach isn't out there playing. He is the weakest link on the team is the coach.
“@CLOSSTHEKING: @BLoso24 @ridiculous252 We wouldn't be in this position if we had a better coach.” Yes I agree with you

BRYANT #1on1  Because he is a better one on one player.

Dwight takes off his jersey on the bench. Remember the last time a superstar took off their jersey in Boston (Lebron)
“@_iAmSosa: Who's better Kobe or Paul Pierce?” I think Celtics fans would say Kobe
#TradeDwightHoward  Immediately before the trading deadline
Mitch Kupchak needs to get his head out of his ass and realize that Dwight is not going to sign with the Lakers this summer. Trade him now
“@RoxieeRoc: The Lakers look so Pathetic. It's embarrassing to watch.” I agree with you 100%
@roe0128 Alright cool I'll talk to you later
@roe0128 Okay you old ass man lmfao
@roe0128 I think if they don't trade him come July he is going to walk away to FA .The Lakers will be fucked because they get nothing
@roe0128 I think they should trade him. He doesn't want to be there. They should trade him to Brooklyn for Lopez Wallace and Brooks
@roe0128 yeah I'm watch it. I wish I could tell you what was wrong with the Lakers.I don't know I don't even think they know what's wrong
If the Lakers trade Dwight to Brooklyn In exchange for MarShon Brooks
 Gerald Wallace and Brook Lopez. It works on the #NBATRADEMACHINE
I think the #Lakers should think about trading Dwight.I would love for D12 to stay with LA.I just think he is getting tired of Kobe shit.

It's almost game time #Lakers vs Grizzlies. Let's go Lakers!!!
@ljtriple I want to see how they play tonight vs Memphis after that meeting they had this morning.
@ljtriple Yeah that's one thing Dwight  needs to learn. When he gets touches he gets turnovers. You still have to trust him.
@ljtriple Yeah what's wrong with that he acts like he scared
@ljtriple Yeah but he's not getting any touches down low.If you watch the game Kobe avoids him.
@ljtriple All he says his Pau needs to be in the post what about Dwight. That right there tells you he has a problem with him.
@ljtriple Yes I agree with that. And I agree with you D'Antoni needs to go. But Kobe needs to trust his teammates.
@ljtriple Don't get me wrong I am a big Kobe fan. i'm just saying he doesn't need to be taken 32 shots in one game and only made10.Really!!!
“@ljtriple: @BLoso24 kobe is not the problem. The coach is the problem.” That's why I said Kobe is PART of the problem.
Kobe needs to look in the mirror and see that he is the part of the problem.
They talk about trading Gasol, D12 and everyone else but they need to put Kobe in his place thats why shaq was traded because of Kobe.
The head coach needs to stop kissing Kobe's ass and lay down the law.
Can anyone see that Kobe is the root of all problems .u bring Nash in to run the offense and Kobe wont allow that to happen.
How would Dwight feel if the Lakers fired D'Antoni and went after Stan Van Gundy.That would be crazy.I would rather have Jeff Van Gundy.
RT @marco1980_: #TradeJimBuss #tradeD'antoni
RT @magic_man24: WE BETTER NOT TRADE DWIGHT!!!
And fire D'Antoni ASAP #Lakers
The #Lakers don't need to trade Dwight . They should trade Pau, cut Blake and Ebanks and maybe Jameson. See what you can get for them.

RT @RampageZayaLA: I wish I could watch Backstage Lakers 😒
The referees need to help the Lakers out eject D'Antoni now.Just give him to quick T's reason being is your offense system sucks.
D'Antoni needs to run into a fucking wall head first and get a concussion and be out Indefinitely. #LAKERS
Put Earl Clark back in the game
Lakers should know every team is going to give their 100% effort vs the Lakers
Ok I'll take that and one for Kobe
Kobe has to drive to the rim. His shots aren't falling. Drive to the rim draw a foul.
About time Kobe
If the Lakers can't beat the raptors. They don't deserve to even think about making a playoff run. This is BULLSHIT!!!
Kobe is 3-13 smh
You have 34-year-old Kobe standing around then you have 39-year-old Steve Nash going after a loose ball really.
Good block Pau
Gasol In the 2nd half has to show the Lakers front office that he should still be a part of the team.
This is who needs to be the Lakers coach @coachdavemiller

@Jessica_Vreede Yes I agree with you. Even though I don't think he should get suspended.
@Jessica_Vreede Yeah but Kobe shouldn't have said that. You have to back up your teammates regardless.
"I think it is the right call. I don't think it was extensive enough to warrante a one-game suspension, but I believe it was a flagrant."
His teammate, Kobe Bryant, however, thought the ejection was warranted.
(This is why Dwight won't sigh w/L.A)

@DionN78 good man
#Audibles If the Jets are willing to shop Sanchez. They should look to see if 49ers would let go of Alex Smith and what it would take.
@annalilia ok! I forget mine you'll see it something similar to my twitter name.
@annalilia what's your game tag me?
@annalilia don't worry about it me too. We should play one day. I'll the Lakers purple and you can be the Lakers white uniforms.

@annalilia what do you play on xbox?
Thank you @DwightHoward for that BIG BLOCK at the end of the game. The beast in the middle. #Lakers
OMG that was close but the #Lakers win
Yeah buddy #Lakers
Halftime #Lakers down 58-53
That blocked by Kobe should be on the top 10 plays of the night #SportsCenter
MWP for 3 again
Dwight looks like he's playing with a lot of energy tonight. I like that. #Lakers
That was nice ball movement Morris to Dwight to Pau back to Dwight #ShowTimeLakers

"@LA_SportsTalk: Should the Lakers have still signed Delonte West even with Nash coming? http://t.co/sfqg0MJ0 #Spreecast"They signed him?
"@LA_SportsTalk: Should the Lakers have still signed Delonte West even with Nash coming? http://t.co/sfqg0MJ0 #Spreecast" yes

Woo hoo #Lakers win. I haven't said that in a while.
Nice play Kobe off that miss from Dwight Howard on the FT line.
"@RenMoibi: @BLoso24 we are winning today don't worry #Lakers" we 3:00 away from snapping that four game losing streak
Kobe has 27 points remember keep it under 30 points
They said that there is 20,308 fans at the Verizon Center watching the #Lakers game now.There is20,300 Lakers fans there only 8 for Wizards
Meeks is on fire
I like Meeks effort tonight he's playing with a lot of energy. #Lakers
Ok i can watch the 2nd half of the #Lakers game. My daughter is in bed cartoons are off
RT @otts_thoughts: #Lakers need to play defense like the Bad Boys of Detroit used to do.
Let's go #Lakers! Let's try to get on track tonight please.
#LakersNation #Lakers head coach is a joke!!!!! I want my $190 dollars back for my NBA League Pass Mitch Kupchak. Thank you!
The #Lakers need to just run the triangle offence... Fuck Mike D'Antoni and that run &amp; gun system.
#LA should run Bickerstaff's offense and defense, until Nash gets back.They were 4-1,and only lost the #SA game by a last second shot.
My prayers go out to everyone affected in that #ConnecticutElementarySchool shooting. Just sick people out there. SMDH!
When Kobe talked to Magic the other day. Magic should have told Kobe you need to trust your teammates. #LakersNation
#Lakers need to pickup Delonte West. He isn't the problem solver but he can run the pick-&amp; roll w/D12 and he's good on defense.
@pedta326 Washington will be motivated and ready i think. They beat the heat already
"@KINGBstatus: @BLoso24 cuz Kobe is a selfish ass player... No such thing as "pass" when it comes to him" I agree 100%
@KINGBstatus yup
@KINGBstatus they don't play defense and they stand around on offense watching Kobe take shot after shot after shot.
@KINGBstatus You got to look ahead now see what games are winnable. That's how bad it is
It's sad we are in the middle of December and #Lakers are looking to get only there 10th win of the season. Smdh!
I see an easy win for the #Lakers on 12/18 vs Bobcats.If the #LA can't beat the Bobcats.Then it's time to painc.
"@GMA: Who wants a leg lamp for Christmas like the one we had on the @GMA set?" I would love a leg lamp
LAKERS FINALLY ARE CONSISTENT - LOSERS. CAN WE TRY BIKERSTAFF FOR A CHANGE . WE HAD A GOOD RECORD DURING HIS SHORT TENURE AT LEAST .

RT @rcblunt: D'Antoni is going to quit before he gets fired
@Ayoo_Sheed fuccking discount double check
RT @ervcas: Seriously Jim Buss needs to hand the keys to the team to Jeanie
If #Lakers fans thought that hiring Mike D was a good idea for the #Lakers you just don't know basketball. Big mistake by the front office.
If the #Lakers want yo trade anyone trade the fucking coach and his stupid system.
After this game #Lakers should tell coach Mike D to walk to Washington for the next game.
Sorry down 19 points at halftime #Lakers
Not bad #Lakers only down 21 fucking points at halftime. Bullshit
@Ayoo_Sheed Watching this bullshit
Let's go #Lakers!
@Tune_DGAF I agree with you
Kobe needs just 29 points tonight.Cuz the #Lakers are 1-10 when Kobe gets 30 or more points.They are 8-3 when he scores less than 30 points.
#Lakers need to get the big man (D12) started fast.
It's almost game time #LakersNation
@_DennyBoo @CJLow79 @SergioArjona @joseericardoo Hell yeah! The #Knicks are going down tonight.
Damn Alicia Keys can get it
P.Diddy
#Lakers 18 turnovers vs cavs tonight  they score 24 points off all the turnovers. #Lakers lost 100-94. #Lakers need to protect the ball.
People can say @DwightHoward FT lost the game for #Lakers. I don't think so.All the turnovers lost the #Lakers that game...
Too many turnovers in the first half for the #Lakers. Smdh!
Duhon needs to stop being scared and shoot the fuckin ball. #Lakers

In the 2nd half #Lakers need to play much smarter than they did in the 1st half. Less turnovers and play better defense.
Halftime #Lakers down 60-51

@BDiesel37 yea i miss LO
Meeks for 3
@BDiesel37 yeah come to think about it now your right
I got Kobe with 14 points in the 1st quarter. #Lakers

Fired D'Antoni  #Lakers
Make them pay @DwightHoward
I don't like D' Antoni substitution rotation. #Lakers

I would have taking Duhon out and left Meeks in put Kobe at the point.
All ball ref #Lakers
Meek for 3

It feels like I'm watching a 3 point contest. #Lakers
This is the Meeks &amp; Jameson show at Staples centers tonight. Let's go #Lakers
Meeks can't miss tonight #Lakers
That was a nice pass by Pau to Jameson
#Lakers need this kind of effort from their bench every game. It would take so much pressure of the starters and less minutes.
Damn Meeks again for 3
End of the 4th #Lakers up 97-82

@BrooksDosEquis okay bet

@DwightHoward pull out the Kareem glasses.#Lakers
Isn't Mark Wahlberg a Boston Celtics fan
Why can't the #Lakers play like this ALL THE TIME
I think Meeks is hot red hot 5-5 from 3's
See the lineup out there now is fine. I would just switch out Pau for D12.
Meeks need to see more playing time. I'm not saying to give Kobe less minutes. They can play them both at the same damn time. #Lakers
Meeks is feeling it. #Lakers
Meeks for 3
End of the 1st #Lakers up 34-27
This is how the #Lakers have to play. Get @DwightHoward involved in the game early.

@smoke281 Yeah that's tru
Look at this Line up
PG. Nash/Calderon SG. Kobe/Meeks SF . Metta/Pietrus PF. Bargnani/ Jamison C. Howard/Hill
What you guys think? #Lakers
The #Lakers need to play the way Bernie Bieckerstaff had them playing, free style and they will start winning games again. Let's go #Lakers!
Mike Brown &amp; Mike D'Antoni are trying to make these guys into system players. Bernie let them do what they do best, play Basketball (4-1).
When D12 goes out move Gasol to Center and Jamison to PF.This was used to incorporate Lamar Odom with the already large front court. #Lakers
Pau needs to be moved closer to the basket. This can be done by doing the Lamar system.
What city, state &amp; trailer park is the winner of the #PowerBall last night.
I only like to watch Duke Blue Devils games. When they show Stephen &amp; Seth Curry mom. That cougar can get it. #JustSaying
Rondo has a bump over his left eye

Hit the road Roy
That's the kind of 3's we need #Lakers
How the fuck did the referee make that call from the locker room
Ok down 4 with 3:16 left. #Lakers need to play good defense on one end and play smart on the offense end of the floor.
#Lakers need to stop taking 3's there is a lot of time left. They are wasting scoring opportunities with all the miss 3 pointers.
Omg Pau is in the game now
Pau you might as well go to the locker room you're not coming back in the game. #Lakers
Let's play defense now #Lakers
Let's go #Lakers

End of the 4th #Lakers down 61-57
13-2 run for the #Lakers
Kobe for 3

Jack Black at the game
#Lakers need to call Toronto and see what kind of deal they can workout for Pau.
I hope after the #Lakers game tonight. That Pau has a pink slip in his locker.  Saying we are looking for a replacement for you.
#Lakers you need to make your FT
Just keep feeding D12 the ball down low.#Lakers
Kobe stop forcing it
Pau is 1/8 tonight pack your bags home boy. #Lakers

Let's go start the 2nd half already. I have to get up early tomorrow morning. #EastCoast #LakersFan

Halftime #Lakers down 40-33
Who has tried that Memphis BBQ burger from Carls Jr?
Black Mamba
Why when Kobe is going inside Pau is standing on the 3 point line.
There is just under 6 minutes left in the first half and all the #Lakers scored is 4 points . WTF #Lakers
Watch out for them elbows they are going to start flying from MWP. #PayBack #Lakers
That was a nice pass by Meeks to D12

Get Delonte West and waive Earl Clark #Lakers
Call me crazy but #Lakers should trade Pau for Stodomiure he played with Steve and he also was coached by D'Antoni.

That was a flop #Lakers
It's raining 3'ssssssss #Lakers
End of the 3rd #Lakers down 82-70
#Lakers please send Duhon back to Duke. So he can be an assistant coach. With the rest of the Duke Blue Devils. That didn't make the #NBA
Wtf was that
Kobe you should have passed that ball back out 1 on 3 &amp; you get blocked. #Lakers
If the other 4 on the floor play with the same energy as D.Morris. The #Lakers would run teams out the building.
#Lakers need to get Dwight involved a little bit more.
Halftime #Lakers down 55-49
Pau should have 1 foot out the door already. Keep playing like shit.
All Pau wants to do is pass the ball to Kobe once he gets the ball. Attack the basket you soft bitch. #Lakers
I see the refs whistle is only working on 1 side of the court. #Lakers
No effort from the #Lakers in the last 14 seconds of the 1st quarter.  SMDH!
End of the 1st quarter #Lakers down 34-18
Keep feeding the ball to Jameson he's hot
I think Pau is intimidated by his LITTLE brother. #Lakers
