@lindsaydawnn thats for sure, I kept yelling at the screen to get them to pull the goalie, too bad they weren't playing hockey
they would have won if they pulled their goalie on time to get out the extra man. Too bad I wasn't their coach to teach them a thing or two
@lindsaydawnn watch your language, your a lady. Ha disappointing and the weirdest ending i think I've ever seen
that would have been awesome to see the one pats player catch it in the middle of 100 giants, congrats #giants
will the #patriots pull this off? I hope so, isn't tom brady considered a football god?
What the hell was that?
totally thought the pats were gonna run away with this but it looks like eli might pull it off again #dejavu
Watching live sporting events on a sweet 1080p tv with 7.1 surround sound blasting out the speakers in the next best thing to being there
watched some of the #SuperBowl from a reflection on my wife's diamond on her wedding  ring, thats pretty sweet #diamondsareaguysbestfriend
totally just got RT by a group called @halifaxtweeters and I'm not even from/in halifax, well that made my night #needstolearngeography
good 300 parody, i enjoyed it, and nick minaj and cee lo seemed like they were actually singing, totally beat black eyed peas for sure 8/10
Going to see the woman in black tonight. Hope it's really good but creepy as hell at the same time
Leafs defense is on fire from Reimer having career high in saves, to half of their defense having a goal tonight. Way to go leafs #TMLtalk
