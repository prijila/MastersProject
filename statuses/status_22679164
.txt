@Betsietwit Danny deserved to go and couldnt you have just said you didnt like Adam instead of using Gay as an adjective.
@JetSetSocialite It shouldnt matter
@LoveYouMcFly You should learn some proper grammar before posting comments.
People shouldnt define others by their sexuality. It shouldnt matter what others do in the privacy of their homes.
I hate that I even have to write this but it must be said that it shouldnt matter if Adam Lambert is gay or not. He Can Sing.
I am getting tired of people using gay as an adjective..People are going to keep it up and there is going to be a nationwide stonewall
@gobullet you must have liked it enough to write about it on here....tell me are you still thinking about it?
Just got done watching college hill and why did this B Katherine say Kyle wanted to be her b/c he was gay.  So all gay men want to be women?

@betterwords thank you so much for saying that gay is not a synonym for shitty I guess people didn't know that....
