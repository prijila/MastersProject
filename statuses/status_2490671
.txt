@SteffanLongdon No. Actually I gave character development 7.92 / 10 and direction 7.83 / 10. It's clearly outlined in the review's matrix.

@slashfilm @AndrewMayne @x_Superstar_x But nothing beats native 3D yet. Conversions still have work to do. Autostereoscopic is next.
@slashfilm @AndrewMayne @x_Superstar_x Creatives vary yes. But their QA is awesome. That's static. They're pros right to the top - Sherak
@slashfilm @AndrewMayne @x_Superstar_x Pete - they're amazing. I toured their HQ and saw them in action. Every month their tech amps up.
@x_Superstar_x Me too. Lots of fun!
@slashfilm @AndrewMayne @x_Superstar_x Disagree Peter. Stereo D is a MASTER now with post conversions. Statements like that are the problem.
@AndrewMayne @x_Superstar_x Optically yes that's accurate, but human 3D is more than that. Stereographers take it all into account.
@AndrewMayne @x_Superstar_x And they BOUGHT those sunglasses. You can buy your own 3D glasses too. Cmon. I wear Oakleys to the theater.

@LazyBride Ahhh yes - living the dream! Well you have perks that I as a Canadian do NOT presently have ;-)
Me too! Save for AVATAR... RT @jahanbakshi: @DrDang: HUGO is the best 3D I've ever seen. Nothing else comes close.
@mousterpiece @BradBirdA113 @nightwriter22: Conversions are fine mostly, but I agree nothing beats native 3D atm. TITANIC 3D? We'll see!
now THERE'S an idea! RT @h_khalifaa: RT @HomeOfEve: I'm wearing a bathing suit and goggles when I go to see Titanic 3D. Idgaf. Yolo.
@mousterpiece @BradBirdA113 @nightwriter22 Agreed. Bad 3D = headaches. Must be bright too but 9/10 it's the theater's fault, not filmmakers.
@nightwriter22 @mousterpiece @BradBirdA113 We're there now for portables. The larger the screen the more the wait. Figure 4 more yrs for tv.
AWESOME!  RT @drdang: I'm so glad I made the trip to another city just to watch HUGO in 3D. #hugo #native3D #scorsese
IMAX 3D is the future RT @nightwriter22: @mousterpiece: @nightwriter22 @BradBirdA113: IMAX is the 21st-century breakthrough in film, not 3D.
