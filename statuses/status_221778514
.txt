@EASPORTSFIFA your servers can just piss off
@hm_custserv I'm also interested in the top Berdych is wearing. Will it be on the UK site?

My word. What a finish from Torres! He has been reborn!  #CopaDelRey
Can't believe I have to wait seven days for the next episode of @BroadchurchTV 😭😭

About time Allardyce took Song off. He's been woefully poor #FACup
City and Chelsea have killed me #FACup
@grzegorz24 Haha, don't think I've ever been that far down! I've got it on TV now. Went on the internet browser on our smart TV and it works

@umbro It would be great if you guys could sell the shirts on the http://t.co/v6Q4YiBrBm site. Some really smart kits there
@Dominiho7 I hope Odegaard doesn't end up like a Granero though! He's on £80k/week? Surely that can't be true
@Dominiho7 It's true that many B team players fail to make the breakthrough but a sell &amp; buy back like Carvajal could also be beneficial
@Dominiho7 At least they have C &amp; B teams which play at a competitive level. That has to help his development
No surprise to see Doumbia making an impact. Such a brilliant goal scorer #AFCON2015
@MacronStore The size guide on your site doesn't include glove sizes. Do you have any size information for them? Thanks
@ThePeoplesGroup Would love to see the stats on how many times we've actually used 3 subs. We never seem to!
@SkySportsMNF I have respect for Pulls. He set up West From perfectly and we weren't good enough to win. Fair play to him #MNF #EFCvWBA
Pulis is the best at what he does and I have a lot of respect for him but when you side is against him, it is so frustrating #EFCvWBA
@rmould @BBCSport Still can't believe it
@rmould He's scored 15/16, how can there be anyone better!
Why the hell was Baines not taking that penalty!? #EVEWBA #MNF
@Cynegeticus Oh right, thanks for the information. I may have foolishly reposted it without checking its veracity
Really starting to despise Katie Hopkins. She's basically just a bully #CBB
@Gonth93 Perez has barely done anything wrong. He's been a bit annoying but that's about it. Katie's gone way over the top

So poor today. Too slow on the ball and it cost us. Questionable tactics from Martinez - clear lack of width. Even Soldado scored... #EFC

@CineKinoVideo @dapperlaughs @BBCNewsnight They showed extreme examples taken out of context. The presenter had a clear personal vendetta

This is going to end up like the @MCFC v @watfordfcsays match. City were 0-2 then but still won #FACup
@RFC_Official are getting beat at home to Albion Rovers. Maybe it is a day for upsets #Wigan #FACup #ScottishCup
Demichelis turns like the Titantic #FACup @btsport
Well the final is going to be poor then. Wanted City v Arsenal final as well so there'd be another Europa League spot in the league #FACup
That's two goals Cattermole has been at fault for now. Shocking. Worst back pass ever. #FACup
It looks like Steve Bruce will be finally going to an #FACup semi final. Great composure by @DavidMeyler7
Oscar Ustari might not ever play a league game for Sunderland but he's certainly a hero in the #FACup now
Love it. Less than a five minute break until the next #FACup match
@Grantearley7 Yeah I suppose but City would demolish Sheff Utd
Arsenal and City better not draw each other in the semis otherwise the final is going to be a non-event #FACup
@btsport Owen Hargreaves' accent is a combination of so may different countries that he almost sounds Jamaican. Or is it just me? #FACup

That was a shocking penalty shootout. Only 3 pens converted out of 10. Really poor. Smash it down the middle. Simple. #CapitalOneCup
Well that lasted long. Penalties are also decent anyway #CapitalOneCup
Oh my god. I got home just in time for that goal. De Gea you've had an absolute shocker. Let your whole team down #CapitalOneCup

Jos Hooiveld's fifth career own goal, fourth in the @premierleague #supersunday #SOUTOT
@grzegorz24 Yeah I think they said that there's a minimum of 15 overs left so there could be more. India may not want it though
#SAvInd will provide some decent half time entertainment. Looks like an exciting finish
@grzegorz24 Yeah, it's going to be a tight finish!
Can't really Adebayor deserved that. It was a poor pass to Soldado but fair play, it was a good finish #supersunday #SOUTOT
Good to see Tim Sherwood going for two up front. Let's just see if it pays off now #supersunday #SOUTOT

@grzegorz24 Yeah that's true and Europa League affecting them this year. Although, Sunderland probably down regardless of cup run
@grzegorz24 Oh yeah. Their cup run didn't do their league form any good
Anyone fancy Sunderland to win the #CapitalOneCup but also get relegated? Do a Wigan and play #EuropaLeague in the Championship.
Ki has made a real difference since he's came on and he deserves that goal. Although I was looking forward to penalties #CapitalOneCup

I knew Deulofeu would score today. Give him a start and he'll do the business #EVESTK #EFC #COYB
@StanCollymore @talkSPORT Deulofeu starting for Everton today. He's an exciting player and deserves the start #COYB
At least we've for the impact of Barkley and Mirallas to come from the bench. We don't always have strong benches #EFC #COYB
I would have liked to have seen Barkley start ahead of Osman. Although it's good to see @Bryan_Oviedo and @gerardeulofeu start #EFC #COYB

Lescott maybe forced to leave in January if he doesn't play more. I'd have him back. Good backup for Baines #EFC #COYB

@MatthewsJoker Yeah okay, I'll be posting every goal on here probably. Hopefully not as many updates as Saturday.
Only good thing about training being cancelled tonight is that I can now go watch the Romsey game. Come on the Town! #RTFC
@sortitoutsi I find the player reviews really useful but it would be good to see a player's history on the game too.
Baines out for up to six weeks. Time to recall @luke_garbutt? #histimehascome #prodicalson #EFC

@MatthewsJoker His son was playing in another match there. Yeah he was probably reporting back to Sky Sports on the match
Rooney didn't want to score another because he knew he should have been sent off. Scoring one and assisting another was enough #CARMUN

@SkyCricket 19/20 of England's wickets were out caught. Anything to read into that apart from failure to manage a short ball? #Ashes
@SkyCricket Starting my #Ashes #CatchUp now. I knew I'd wake up to a loss but I was expecting more of a fight
I have a feeling when I wake up in the morning the first test will be over #Ashes #CatchUp
@salterjack Too true, too true
@salterjack Yeah if the referee hadn't stepped in when he had, then he probably would have taken stick for not stopping it soon enough
@grzegorz24 Yeah but the split second decision is the difference between life and death and it's tough for a boxing referee
All these pundits are saying that it was a bad decision but if they were in the referee's position with a split second decision #Skyboxing

What was Pienaar doing in the wall. If he closes the gap, Suàrez doesn't score. Need Lukaku to improve in 2nd half too #EVELIV #EFC
Nice plug for renewable energy there by @btsport... #EVELIV
@btsport could have at least gone to the ground like Sky usually do rather than just staying in their studio #EVELIV
@JamesPhi11ips Barry has got him covered
Good to see Barkley back in our starting XI. That's a strong side we've put out and they're weaker with Sturridge on the bench #EVELIV
Wow we are getting destroyed. Can't believe how Carberry got out though. So unlucky #CatchUp #Ashes
Good start. The first time I've watched the #Ashes live so far and we've got an early wicket #StayUp

Another 45 minutes for England in which Sturridge has failed to perform in. Hopefully he'll improve in the second half #ENGGER #itvsport

I know the U21s need Morrison for their qualifiers but it would have been decent to see him playing in the senior tea! #NORWHU #SNF
West Ham's system called 4-2-4-0? #SNF #NORWHU
