@dktrlewis Apparently the new ticket machines are meant to be there according to @SouthernRailUK but I see no evidence of them at all!

@BrightonHoveBus Last time I emailed about a bus driving straight past me resulting in me missing a hospital appointment there was no reply.
@BrightonHoveBus 20 min wait for the 49 at Elm Grove this morning because the 9.18 didn't show up. Do you think this is acceptable?! #Fuming
@TobyaLocke @brightonhovebus @firstcc Times like this I wish I could drive...
Another day where I will most likely be late for work thanks to the unreliability @BrightonHoveBus Terrible service everyday!!
I do enjoy watching a couple of new (to me) episodes of Family Guy. It is definitely funnier when fresh.
Homemade (not by me) coffee cake for breakfast. Today is a good day üç∞

@SamuelJPoon Well done, sir! That is quite the achievement.

RT @GuerrillaF: It's official - one week to go. #guerrillafashion #brightonfashion #brightonartsclub
The detox continues. Although it was very very hard indeed to resist having a joint last night after the long working week.
A guy with THE most annoying voice is sitting behind me on the bus. I can't even concentrate on my book because of the way he talks!
Forgot all of my smoking materials this morning and have had to buy everything anew. Very irritating.

I can see some blue sky! That hasn't happened in a while.
I am really not made for such early rising.
I think I like Twitter more than Facebook. There. I said it.
#MyLifeIn5Words Sorry I'm late; I overslept üò¥
@SamuelJPoon Oh dear :( Are they all mended now?
Today is a fucking NIGHTMARE!!
Why is it that every time I am in a rush every single light is red? And the driver goes a retarded way?
It is just shaping up to be another one of those Tuesdays I guess.
Worst morning ever. Massive oversleep and so I am having to get a taxi to work. And I have managed to lose a contact lens BEHIND MY EYE.
Found the ¬£1.99 lighter! And now to celebrate; by using it to light my bedtime joint.
I love the inventor of the online food shop and delivery service. Absolute genius!!
I am connected to free WiFi on the bus. What ever next?!
After less than 24 hours I have lost the ¬£1.99 lighter. This is enough to make me bitter.
Just finished watching American Horror Story Asylum. Was I the only one bothered by the alien story arc? Laziness on an otherwise ace show!
@DibbyDah Got to put a positive spin on these sort of situations :)
Fuck it. I have a bottle of wine in my bag, may as well crack it open!
Delayed Virgin train service from New Street has made me miss my connecting train. So now I have an hour to kill at Watford Junction. Joy.
And so long, Birmingham!
¬£1.99 for a disposable lighter? Fuck you, WH Smith. FUCK YOU!!! üò°
The main thing I miss about Birmingham? Apart from @mrchnry of course? Tall buildings? Brighton is like the midget sibling.
Bye bye Wednesbury! Until next time.
Got me a belated Christmas cracker from my fabulous grandparents ‚ò∫ http://t.co/GMmQbgfj
And they don't understand why this upsets me. I may not bother coming here for five years. See how 'loved' that makes them feel.
This means that I will have lived in Brighton for FIVE YEARS before they will have bothered to come and see me.
So, I have just been told that my mom and stepdad's trip down to Brighton has been put back again; apparently they will be coming in summer.
@esther2962 Isn't she?! Very anti social though, she hasn't been downstairs once today yet :) x
My mother's cat, Candy. Quite possibly the fluffiest and grumpiest kitty ever üò∏ http://t.co/xRRqafV4
Feeling rather seriously unwell. I don't want to travel back to Brighton in this condition :(
Very excited about Poets vs MCs this evening!! Gonna be a fabulous old eve üòÉ
I do love a good ghost documentary. Or a bad one üëª
Re-discovering @Hot_Chip ‚ù§ I had almost forgotten how much I love them!
Also, fuck @BrightonHoveBus The most unreliable service I've the displeasure of having to deal with everyday. Can't even reply to an email!!
I would be in a relatively awesome mood if it wasn't Tuesday. Fuck Tuesdays; the arse hole of the week in my humble opinion.
One more episode of American Horror Story Asylum before bed I think. I am too hardcore for nightmares after all üòå
I am developing a serious crush on Zachary Quinto. He is a beautiful man!
Urgh, I hate hate hate going to the doctors all the time for stupid steroid cream. Can't wait to get the light therapy started again!
I want a hug. I would probably employ someone to be my full time big spoon if I could.
Is it lame that I am already seriously considering going to bed? I am so tired it hurts.
I wonder what Mr Scott Heron would think about the Jamie XX re-mixes of his songs...?
Although after saying that, the 'I'm New Here' is so perfect and personal to that time of my life it makes me cry every time I listen to it.
As much as I love Gil Scott Heron, his long ass spoken openings to some of his songs really annoy the hell out of me.
Sorting through my @Spotify playlists should be a full time (and paid) job!
Today is so cold I am going to try and stay in bed all day until I have I go out tonight.
@esther2962 Do you think it is a good thing? I certainly would!! Just ignore the subject matter I reckon x
@esther2962 You are trending!! Well, your name is at least :D x
Well that was quite delicious. Go me!
I am cooking a curry for my house mates this evening. And I am making it up as I go along. Fingers crossed this goes to plan!
@rdjharris I shall have a wee listen this eve and get back to you! X
This film is making me love the 1920s even more. I really need to start watching more silent movies; they make me happy.
RT @rdjharris: Please check my new band out on #spotify #noexitplan #outofthedark #bigtunes #pleaseshre http://t.co/5SEMuTdQ
So I went to work, and got sent home early because of the snow. Now to celebrate with tea, a joint, and watching The Artist.
I am not sure if I am hoping for snow when I wake up or not! Impromptu (potential) fun day in the snow, or unpaid day from work?! ‚ùÑ‚õÑ
Ha! Even the thought of doing that makes me laugh. Let's just see how this one pans out.
I just survived a 10 hour work day. And another lined up for tomorrow! I feel I should go straight to bed when I get home in preparation.
I should be asleep. Tomorrow is going to be a long old day. Why aren't I asleep?!
I think I am going to start watching 'Heroes'. Haven't seen it before. Want to. Job done.

I think I need a nap. I may not wake up until tomorrow üí§üí§
@SamuelJPoon So where is this buffet place you always go to on a Sunday eve?
Being bad and getting take out. Yummy #BhindisBrighton @JustEatUK  üòèüëçüí∏üç≤
Shower in two parts because there is no hot water left. Way to fuck my perfect Sunday water tank. Sad face.
I really hope Die Antwoord play some live UK dates soon. I would love to see them live!
@KT_Snaydon Why yes, yes I am! üòÑ Is the soundtrack good, they all seem able to sing okay?
@KT_Snaydon Who are you going with? Rarer looking forward to hearing your opinion in the film before going to see it myself!
A day of productivity!! I guess it needs to happen every once in a while üòä
Today is a two spoonfuls of coffee kind of day.
@SamuelJPoon A place called Cafe Bistro on George Street, just off St James Street. Recommended, if for the price alone!
Pizza Face - the first time @MartinGJames and I have had it, and already my favourite pizza place in Brighton!
¬£1 coffee at a rather funky little coffee shop? I think I could get used to this sort of behaviour on my day off üòè
Today is a hip hop day. Booyah.
Sometimes I worry my own mind shall drive me insane. Far too much over thinking going on!!
Today is my day off, and with a list of things I need to get done I am confident that today I shall achieve something good :)
Wow, I am on an Angelina Jolie flex at the moment. Third film starring her in as many weeks starting now! üëÄ Obviously wearing my gay hat üòç
@DibbyDah Because it looks fabulous
@DibbyDah You aren't crazy! The UK has lots of marvellous people after all. Like me!! :D

@DibbyDah I need your address!! Penpal-Dom will start upon receipt :) xx
Beautiful new bag I have been waiting weeks for!! Today is clearly going to be a good day üòÑüëú
Got a parcel to pick up before work this morning. It could be anything! I am excited - this is a good start to my day.
@SamuelJPoon It is an option. Most likely not one that I shall follow through with though...
I really want to get a chest piece tattoo, but I can't decide of what! I need some inspiration here.
Is it weird that listening to The Distillers makes me horny? Like, every time?
Awesome date night; happy Gemma üòä
@stuwalsall Actually, lot f kisses for Gemma! Turns out he smokes after a couple of drinks :D
RT @itsWillyFerrell: #MentionAChildhoodGame: If you never jumped from one couch to the other to avoid lava, you never had a childhood.

I just 'met' a fellow called Art McFall. With a name like that he must be the coolest person in the world.
Starting to regret Sunday overtime working. Just think of the money and the trip to Thailand in April...
@mrchnry I am jealous!!! Are you having a wonderful time?
@esther2962 Is this a bad thing?
Caffeine come down!! üò≥‚òï
Finally got my hair cut!! Feeling like it may be a little short though üíá

At what point do you go from being chipper to annoying?
Amazing Friday mood today! Fingers crossed it lasts a day of work üôàüôâüôä
@mrchnry Check out 'Who By Fire' by Buck 65. Cover of the Leonard Cohen song, and my favourite song at the moment.
@mrchnry Ooooo, this makes me happy. I shall make with the music sharing, and then you shall also be happy x
@DibbyDah glad you had fun! But boo for the having to get back to normal :( We need to arrange a Skype date soon.
My outfit today kind of makes me look like a 17th century witch. I am rather enjoying the fake dress up.
@mrchnry Sadly you do need to read the book to fully understand everything that goes in. &amp; I am still really unsure about Emma Watson in it
@DibbyDah This makes more sense :) I miss you too! Did you have a fabulous Christmas and New Year?
I have felt kind of sick all day and it just seems to be getting worse. I wish my stomach would either man up or throw t up.
@DibbyDah As a pet?
Must admit that I have felt pretty sexy walking round in my rand new high heels today. Must admit my feet are a little aches now though.

@SamuelJPoon Have you tried asking them maybe? You never know until you try.
So I have just been asked out on a date with a delightful gentleman I meet at last night's party. This pleases me üòÉ
Why am I even awake this early? I didn't leave the party until 7.30am.
I feel like poop. Big old joint and then back to sleep I think.
Awesome night though!!!
I would like to take a moment to mourn the loss of my favourite grey cardigan. It was perfect *sob* üò≠
The only time I seem to feel normal today is when I am eating! Must stop - a bloated NYE out will not be a fun one üòÅ
It is stupid windy today, and it is already really pissing me off. Down with the wind!!
I hate it when I can't sleep üòûüëé Luckily tomorrow night shall be chemically enhanced.

As usual with the punctuality from Gemma. Why is being on time so difficult for me?!
@dktrlewis No idea as of yet, I may try and save myself for NYE though.
@dktrlewis So, what do you and Florian (sp?) have planned for the weekend?
@dktrlewis Have you ever read it? Worth a look see?
Ha!! I think I have beaten the hangover :D
Wow, I feel crappy this morning.
I can't stop watching zombie films! I am on my third one of the night; intervention might be needed.
(Almost) midnight snack of crackers and humus. Yummy.
Rather enjoying the never ending grazing on food which Boxing Day allows üç¥
I can't believe that I slept for that long! And, as it is Boxing Day, I think that I might just not get dressed al day in celebration!
And now everyone has left, I think that we are quite entitled to say that @MartinGJames and I make wonderful Christmas Day hosts üòÉ

Well, I was far drunker last night than I should have been :(
@Ozzy_Lee_2009 I am grand thank you! Rather hung over today though. How are you? Looking forward to Christmas? Xx
@AshleyNHorne Brighton is the best place to have an adventure after all ‚ò∫
I am sure a delightful time will be had by all though!
Work Christmas night out this eve. Obviously I am still not 100%, as I half wish that I could stay in and chill out.
Leaving for work in the rain when it is still dark is one of the most depressing things there is.
Not looking forward to work at 8am. Working Saturdays makes my face sad üòî
Treated myself to some cherry and vanilla tobacco today. Delicious with liquorice papers!
@stuwalsall ...until Christmas to open it as well :D xx
@stuwalsall I will not! Oh my, I got your parcel yesterday. Meant to text but completely forgot. Thank you! And I am being good and waiting

I am tempted to get stupidly drunk so I forget how wretched I am feeling. That is as good a reason as any other, right?
The book 'I Am Legend' is so so much better than the film. Than all of the film versions in fact (there are three don't you know).
Being ill is the best excuse to watch Will Smith film after Will Smith film in bed; already on number two.

The inside of my clementine looks like a tree in winter ‚ùÑüå≥‚ùÑ http://t.co/hN2QnRZj
@Robynenglish89 Oh no, have you be taken down too? Rubbish!! How did Secret Santa go? I am annoyed I missed it :( x
Somehow there is a fly in my tea. I was enjoying that as well :(
Being stoned and super congested is an odd sensation indeed.
My head feels like it is filled with cotton wool, and breathing is not as easy as you might imagine. Can't wait to feel normal again!
OD'ing on clementines before bedtime in the hope the vitamin C will make me better by the time I wake up again üçäüíäüçä

Just finished reading this. Rather eye opening view in classism today - recommended. http://t.co/d2HFQp2B
Just about to watch Event Horizon; haven't seem it in rather a while and quite intrigued to see if it is as good as I remember it bring.
Hana just got me a 'get well soon' Toblerone - my favourite. I love my friends ‚ù§
Going to dose myself up and then try and sleep until I am feeling better. Which will hopefully be sooner rather than later!
I am feeling so ill and sorry for myself that I have even bought some cough syrup. I never get that stuff normally.
After less than an hour at work I am already in my way home sick. Going to dose up on anti flu meds and spend the day in bed.
Well, today is just going to be awesome. Just had to jump off the bus on the way to work to puke. I hate being ill.
I just won my first ever eBay auction! That was certainly thrilling! ‚ò∫üëöüíåüéâ I can see that becoming a little addictive.
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. I hope that I'm not going to be ill for Christmas. I think that it may be time to detox from now until then.
Nose bleed :(
I am not emotionally stable today - just found myself crying when reading about the Newtown school shooting.
I am suffering today. I wish I was able to just say in bed all day long.
@SamuelJPoon Wow, just wow.
I love how a simple 5 minute walk home can be a 15 minute singing and dancing spectacular with the simple addition of a hearty dose of ket üíã
No wonder I am always ill at the moment, going from freezing cold to boiling hot.
Sitting at work today is like sitting in a sauna. It feels about 25 degrees in here! üòïüî•‚òÄ
Even my eye balls are feeling sore üòû I think tonight shall bring an early night to bed.
Every part of me aches. I should be in bed, not going to work :(
I do ever so enjoy my bedtime smoke.
@DibbyDah Glad to hear you arrived okay. Have a marvellous time!
There are never enough crisps in a bag.
@stuwalsall I don't think there is any saving me from my green dreadlocks fetish. But thanks for trying :D
@DibbyDah I woke up sad too. But you will be happy when you get to see everyone and party! Safe travelling my love, miss you already &lt;3 xx
Why is it every time I see a guy with green dreads I instantly fancy him? It is wicked hot.

I am wearing my hair in a quiff today. I hate quiffs, unless I am going out to a sweaty club or going to bed. Why did I do this to myself??
Newly clean pyjamas, freshly washed sheets, very snug and content Gemma üòç

@DibbyDah Okay, well I need go go somewhere fairly reasonably priced for food and drink, so do you have any idea where you fancy drinking?
@dibbydah Could we meet at 8 instead please? I need to pick from Seven Dials first x

I din't want to have to deal with another day of system issues, it makes the day longer than it should be üòû
This is the sort of weather for cuddles under a blanket and lots of Baileys coffee. Oh yes.
It is colder than hell this morning! Surely it must snow soon, I want to build a snow man!! ‚õÑ
I would like you to just contemplate Chuck Norris for one moment. Go on. It made my evening a little richer.

@penniesfrom87 Aww, thank you :) Did you have a lovely birthday?
@dibbydah I could maybe be persuaded to take part in this sort of activity.
It pains me to say, but sometimes it does get a little boring listening to boys play their guitars and no one is talking, let alone to me.
@DibbyDah The ending was okay. But the monsters?! WTF?! Four giant legs and a body made of tentacles? I wasn't impressed I am afraid.
The Mist could quite possibly be one of the worst films that I have ever seen. AVOID!!
Getting my inner geek on.
I want to spend the entire day in bed with hugs and cuddles. Feeling rather down in the dumps.

I asked for flowers and you brought flowers. I wanted to dance and you danced. You asked for my love and I gave back the flowers.
Rather enjoying lying in bed and listening to the rain.

One week until my birthday :D
Monday nights are quickly becoming my favourite learning/chilling  evenings.
Think I have got 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' down on Ike :D
The film #TimberFalls is a definite advert for not having sex before marriage. Yikes!!

Getting really fucking fed up of being people's verbal punching bag. I am going to have to start making cuts in my life.
I think I shall be spending most of this afternoon napping.
Not only being awake at this hour on a Saturday but being at work as well is truly the greatest form of torture.
I always feel a bit liberated after stopping following someone.
A lovely afternoon in the garden is a fabulous way to spend the day, especially when receiving guests :)
Need to get me an unbroken bed. That was the worst night sleep I have had in a LONG time.
Seriously painful throat today. Not another cold already. Please!

Rebel Without A Cause may well be my new favourite film.
Especially when that means it is now only two days until Carly time! :D
Well that was surprisingly painless. I do like it when there is another Monday under my belt.
Just finished the last of the Harry Potter books. little bit gutted I must admit!
Is it wrong that I prefer this to the original...? https://t.co/LOzL0E6o!
Tea, joint and Harry before bed on a Sunday night, don't mind awfully if I do (I am allowed to be homely after the weekend I have just had)
Oooo, I feel rough.
My life is better than yours. Unless you are famous. Then you probably win this one.
I shall go the ball! Whether that is because I am hardcore or stupid remains to be seen however...
Wow. I just flashed my underwear at work. I am so smooth at times I scare myself.
@mrchnry Please excuse me sir. I should hope you will forgive me.
@mrchnry Lies. Damn lies!
@mrchnry Ain't really got too much choice if I want to keep up with everyone. It is a hard, yet, fabulous, life. And anyway, don't you too?
How am I meant to go to a pool party on Saturday with a head cold?? Please, send get well Gemma vibes. I need this.
I feel sick and I have a super nasty head cold. I should be at home in bed, not out in society.
Brighton life can be very hard to resist at times.
I have just been called and asked to go out on an alcohol fuelled  Wednesday night dancing session.
I just had a moment of pure adoration when looking over my music collection.

I don't think you will ever fail to make me happy @prof_elemental :D http://t.co/pT8Jh2dW
I think that mushy pea fritters are very possibly my new love.
@esther2962 I am very pleased that I have managed to miss everything so far, haven't seen anything of it at all :) x
@mrchnry I'll let you know how Dune turns out. Although my hopes aren't high. It's David Lynch, and him and I have a tendency to disagree.
@mrchnry Slice? What does that even mean? I have added to the list of must sees though, thank you kindly for the recommendation :)
@mrchnry Dune.
No doubt I shall hate it, that is normally the way that these things go with me.
I am now going to attempt to watch one of those there 'classic' films I have failed to watch before now.
M.I.A. never fails to be bad ass.
It is strange how it is possible to judge the messiness of the night before based on the state of my smoking tin the following day.
The Bloodhound Gang - amazingly guilty pleasure.
I am starting to feel like a broken person. I think I might just go and sit in the bath and cry a little.
Why are there so many stupid people in the world? Bah! I might just go back to bed and avoid it all.
Today I have failed at life again. I must stop being a loser quite so often!
'A dream in a mist of grey'
I really think that I am one of those people who looks better when kind of dishevelled and messy. It just works, y'know?

@vixenrules Ah, thank you! We should have a girly night some point, get Skye and Eva involved. I think that would be lovely :) x
RT @white_mink: Check out Nick Hollywood's vinyl only radio special here: http://t.co/tocfnzdY including behind-the-scenes pics...
Looking forward to the colour fading out somewhat so I can add some pink and purple to my hair for good measure :D
I might have a glitter party to prevent rumours started. Actually, a glitter party sounds fun regardless.
I am not sure how happy I am now that I accidentially look like a goth.
@stuwalsall I think I am going to have to give it another go, see if my impression improves a second time round.
@stuwalsall Did you not feel that TDKR left alot to be desired in the action scenes? I wanted more!! Maybe I was expecting too much...
Two films that have really disappointed me this weekend - 'The Dark Knight Rises' (it pains me to say that) and 'Ted'.
Woke up this morning and forgot I dyed my hair yesterday, didn't quite recognise myself in the mirror!
@rdjharris Well, now I know. Thanks for clearing up the square situation sir :)
@rdjharris Why can I only see a square?
@rdjharris The bizarre couple thing? I do believe so.
Wow. http://t.co/G2S1miRW
Oh my gosh, a moth just landed on my neck! That was strange and unpleasant.
@magdalenasek Have a lovely time at Stanmer Park :) xx
@magdalenasek All I have gotten out of bed for today is breakfast and a bath, so I am doing a pretty good job of following your advice x
@magdalenasek Yes, I shall be there, although I doubt I shall be enjoying it xx
@magdalenasek No, I cancelled because I'm ill. I have this horrible cold that seems to be going round, can hardly breathe for coughing :(
I just split orange juice in my bed :(
I may start a commune in the middle of no where and just invite along the people that I like and can tolerate.
People are narrow minded, stupid, and oppressive. Sometimes I just wish everyone would just fuck off.
@DibbyDah I wanted to go top Arundel this weekend, but no one would go with me :( Or at least, no one got back to me. I am jealous.
@DibbyDah What castle are you in? I would stay there forever, I love castles.
I feel like I am on my death bed.
I think I shall treat myself to a drink or two in celebration of my awesome decision making.
Definitely the best life choice that I have made to date.
Brighton has this strange ability to make me feel warm and fuzzy when I remember I live here.
I am going to buy myself a mug tomorrow. I have never had a proper mug of my own that only I can use. This will CHANGE!
This is going amazingly and surprisingly well.
Right then, I am now on day one of a vegetarian (standard) and gluten free (brand new part) diet. Let's see how this turns out.
I miss my surroundings having sharp and defined edges.
Maybe I am going blind because the old wives tales are true :O
My vision has been rather blurred for the entire day thus far. This is starting to cause me a little concern.
Very hungover. But oh so worth it.
"Hurry up and be yourself, its almost illegal" (source unknown).
I still have a job!! Gemma is going to get drunk tonight!
No matter how today pans out, I shall be getting wasted tonight. Hopefully it shall be in celebration, but hey, I'll take comiseration too.
So stressed out about today. And I have a super headache :s

@magdalenasek You are more than welcome my lovely :) xx
I do love having friends round and cooking dinner.
I am on the prowl!!
Ooo, I do love the magical finds that I make at charity shops :) Beautiful new dress, and I was only going to the doctors!
@stuwalsall I won't be able to until I get home I am afraid. Just search for it on Youtube, it is a clip from Russell Howard's TV show x
My favourite part of the day is quickly becoming walking across the Level each morning. I really enjoy it.
@stuwalsall Well I am pleased that you have finally seen the light :) Have you siin the Daily Mail cancel song?
@stuwalsall Why are you boycotting the Daily Mail? Although I do think that you should have done that a while ago :) x
@stuwalsall I am really not a fan of the Olympics. Yay for the boost to the economy and what not, but I guess it just ain't my bag :s
@stuwalsall Well, that was kind of my general life plan if I am honest... :)

This. :D http://t.co/kk4FNRYq
Wedding day today!! (Not mine of course)
HAPPY 1,000th TWEET TO ME :D
Thinking of maybe watching Superbad for the first time. I am kind of getting nostalgic for a bit of Michael Cera for some odd reason.
I am really rather enjoying my first Friday night in in my lovely new house :D
I have a plethora of cupcakes and not a single pair of purple trousers. What is a girl to do?
@dibbydah Oh yes, I forgot. Have a wonderful time! And we must meet when you get back :)
I feel lonely today, I want company. Which is strange; I am never normally needy and always rather enjoy my own company.
What I really want is breakfast in bed, followed by some serious X Files watching.
I would give a shiny penny to still be curled up in bed. I really wish I was more of a morning person :s
I must stop drinking on school nights. Bluergh.
I wish I wasn't drunk again.
My wardrobe was delivered today, and now my clothes are out of boxes... I am completely unpacked! YAY :D
Ponder; is it possible to love someone you don't even like?
Being at work today is pratically criminal :s
RT @mrskimyadawson: Who wants to design a badass swingset/playground/fort and build it in my backyard before 2pm on Saturday?
@DibbyDah Yes!! We just need to think of something that we can be secretive about! :D
A lovely evening had with my old housemate, dinner and wine combo really is a classic :)
I would rather like to form a secret society you know, it seems like an awful lot of fun.
@magdalenasek I don't really want to go into it on Twitter to be honest. Hang on, I shall text you :) x
@KT_Snaydon Cover up!! Don't get burned!!
@KT_Snaydon Never sunburn!! Why is that even one of your options?? x
The next thing I am going to get myself liking is green tea (I think I may have to give up on the pickled eggs)
@magdalenasek Have you heard back yet? x
@stuwalsall Thank you! You remain, as always, my favourite :) xx
Maybe I should just follow my friends without them knowing about it. Or is that weirder?
That looks a lot creepier than I imagined it would. Not creepy stalking, just to have a little adventure from time to time.
I have already followed cats to see where they take me. I might upgrade to people.
@magdalenasek Have you had your meeting yet? How did it go? Or good luck if it hasn't happened yet!! xx
My friend @stuwalsall sent me an amazing present in the post and I am very happy now. Why isn't everyone else sending me things?
Definitely feeling rather worse for wear today :s
Today is going super fast! Obviously looking forward to tonight's mis-adventures :D
Not to made up about having all my clothes in boxes for another two days though.
Got to admire their honesty I guess :s
My wardrobe delivery has been postponed from today to Thursday because it is 'too hot' to deliver today apparently.
Two early nights later and I am still sleepy and yawning away. This moving malarky is more exhausting than I remember it being!
Junk food, green, and cider is all I am good for this evening I think.
@mrchnry I am on the verge of tears here. Worse day in a long while. Hoping I can rally a drinking group tonight.
SHIT day. I shall be drinking tonight.

I am unpacked!! Well, everything apart from my clothes. Bring on wardrobe delivery on Tuesday :)
I have moved!! And now for the fun part, unpacking :)
I wish I didn't move my stash box already. The smell of weed is making me want a joint rather than do the stuff I need to. Will power!!
@DibbyDah That is pretty good going, well done :) So that is two little rewards for you on Tuesday. Have a grand old night x
The packing is going well! I think I should be all done by 10 :) Then early night for the final MOVE! :D
@DibbyDah If you get to 2,000 then you shall be rewarded with something very special. Deal?
@DibbyDah Also, I have found a brown cropped faux fur jacket I think you may like if you want it? It will go to the charity shop otherwise x
@DibbyDah Okay, I have just sorted out my shoes, coats, and bags. All that is left now is my clothes pretty much! Now time for joint break!
@DibbyDah Okay, so another 200 words for reward number two... :)
@DibbyDah I am packing :( And yes, I have sorted out some clothes, so progress has been made! Shall we check in in another hour?
@DibbyDah So, how many words do you have?
Okay. I shall check in at 6.15. And no cheating missy! :)
@DibbyDah Okay. I shall be in touch in an hour. How many words shall I expect for you to get a reward from me on Tuesday?
@DibbyDah Let's encourage each other!! I am still finding every excuse manageable to not do my packing! I am such a loser it is unreal :(

There is a serious possibility that things are just not going to go to plan at all. I need an organiser!
So plan for today; work until 2pm, go to new house, build bed, go to old house, finish packing, move things to new house, unpack, go out.
I am tired of being this stressed! I feel like I am en route to a heart attack at this rate :(
Torrential rainstorm out of nowhere, and it seems to be happening only at the front of my house...
Wardrobe bought, bed frame bought, joint rolled and waiting, final stage of sorting and packing to commence in three, two, one...
@dibbydah It is pretty shocking isn't it? Shame on them I say.
Girls! Stop wearing shorts so short your ass is hanging out!! It really isn't a good look (unless you are performing on stage).
I really want a pair of purple high tops

@dibbydah If you do I shall miss you :s x
I also wish that I had a strawberry Cornetto.
I wish that I was so wasted right now that I forget who I am and why I am here...
I need a day off! This is becoming the longest week in history... :s
And now all my books are packed up and ready to be transported tomorrow evening :)
The new house is already feeling like home, and I haven't even moved in properly as of yet!
@magdalenasek Thank you! But oh my gosh, I feel absolutely sick with nerves :( And still no Trevor yet either... x
So bloody nervous about this morning, fingers crossed it all goes well...
Working full time and moving house around it is proving difficult after only one day. Never felt this tired before. Coffee!!

I think my love affair with #StowfordPress is one that is going to be the one that lasts until the day I die.
I WANT A MOSTACHE SHAPED NECKLACE!! I feel it could be life changing.
@dibbydah I wish I was about. I am at work instead. Boo!! Haha, Damage is awesome. Hard to stay still when getting the hair cut normally!
Would quite like to celebrate my new found Godliness by sitting in a pub and drinking whisky.
Could it be that our house shit is sorted? If so, go me!! I am clearly God.
@zoegrace92 Well done on the first Tweet my dear! Here is to a very happy virtual relationship :) x
As much as I adore #OscarWilde, my mood is definitely a little brighter now I have started re-reading #HarryPotter.
Nothing like a bit o' electro swing in the morning to set you up for having a grand old day.
And if not, I may be forced to go on a bit of a rampage. Gemma vs Lettingg Agents. Round two.
Well, I am sure today can only be better than yesterday :)
Plus I am so hungry it feels like I didn't eat anything at all yesterday. Big breakfast before work I am thinking :)
Bleurgh. No where near enough asleep last night. Today is going to be loooong....

@dktrlewis I have just had hard boiled egg, cheese and Marmite on toast. Followed by a cup of tea. And it were grand!! :)
@magdalenasek You will be banned from overtime for a week for calling in sick. Did Luke take emergency holiday or call in sick? x
@magdalenasek I am grand thank you. Ran into Kris at the Volks on Friday night, I shall tell you all about it when I see you tomorrow xx
And there is the distinct possibility I now have a crush on an 8 year old. Oh dear.
15 hours later and I return to the world of awake. Suffering for the decadence of the weekend thus far.
@magdalenasek How are you doing today my darling? xx
This is going to be a painful day and a half. Need sleep... Not tired...
Is your ice cream melting really quickly too, or am I just really hot?
Walking the streets of windy Brighon eating yummy ice cream
Feeling frustrated. I need to shake this feeling.

Beautiful boy with adorable dog sitting on the bus this morning. I might have to shimmer over to say hello...
Hair has fallen perfectly and looks amazing. And the sun is out! Today is going to be a good day :)

Not too sure how appropriate it is to send a near stranger a video of sexually explicit content...

Starting to get a little weirded out by my strangely good and chipper mood today. Life is good it seems!
Relationships are like fat people; most of them don't work out.
Who would have ever thought it. It is Monday morning, and I don't mind that I am awake and getting ready for work :)
I think I have killed Meg (my plant).
@magdalenasek I think I may be a new convert :)
Too lazy to go and make new tea and so I will drink cold tea instead.
My little brother has turned into one of the loveliest young men that I know :) So proud of him.
Happy fathers day, to those both here and not xx
@DibbyDah Wow! Maybe you should. Ha ha x
@magdalenasek I miss you too, you sexy strumpet x
@magdalenasek Don't worry, I am taking all necessary precautions :) I shall give you a call tomorrow lovely lady xx
@magdalenasek I am going to go for coffee with Maxine, make an appointment to get my hair done for after pay day, and then nothing. You? x
@magdalenasek Ah, okay. Wow, that really spun me out for a moment there :s x
@magdalenasek Isn't it 2012 now though? It is 2012, right? Oh wow, now I am confused... xx
Why don't I own a pair of jeans? What sort of girl am I?!
@DibbyDah T'is an interesting story, I shall tell you all about it over a hot beverage :) x
Three and a half hours sleep, and feeling surprisingly good! Although I may be appreciating the coffee date with @DibbyDah soon.
@DibbyDah Okay, cool. Do you know where Kensingstons is? Shall we meet there at 2? x
@DibbyDah Although I am free all day so whenever really (as long as its not too early :) ) x
@DibbyDah Maybe about 2 or 3 if that is good for you? x
@DibbyDah To try and stop you thinking that, fancy going for a coffee tomorrow? I would suggest something stronger, but on anti-biotics

And this makes me feel bad.
Although most of the time I consider myself to be a nice person, sometimes I can't stop venomous thoughts crossing my mind...
@galadarling Dancing around my bedroom to electro swing! :)
Argh!! There is just too much amazing music in the world! How am I meant to discover, listen to and love it all?!
@DibbyDah Thank you lovely! Not sure why I have struggled to work that out for so long without just asking :/
@KT_Snaydon Ah, thank you :) Still not too sure what that means exactly, but I am sure that I can use my intelligence :) x
What does #ff mean?
I can pretty much guarantee that my Friday has a better soundtrack than yours :) #ElectroSwing #JuiceRadio
@DibbyDah I know. I try and be super annoyingly nice to people like that, it cheers me up in any case x

That shit is deep maaan.

Looking for the reset button. Maybe I should go for the power button instead.
Won't you take me to FUNKY TOWN!!
And now to transform this coughy, runny mess into a vision for tonight's activities... This could take a while....
I would literally give my left arm to stop coughing right about now!!

@official_sarc Isn't it a fabulous episode?! Definately one of my personal favourites :)
Although I have only been away for 4 days and when I return the country has gone crazy! These are indeed bad, and scary, times :s
#Playgroupfestival was amazing beyond words. Missing being surrounded by dancing woodland animals already!
Rain rain, please go away. I would rather not sleep in the mud all weekend if you would be so kind. Thank you ever so! :)
Holiday begins here! Bring on the weekend of festival goodness!! #excited
Let down again. Why do I continue to put myself in this situation? I am nearing the end of my paitence.
@official_sarc Boo. I promise I won't tease you with all things tasty. That would be mean. And I am too nice for such behaviours :)
@official_sarc That mean you are going to have to start avoiding pizza and become a lover of all things salad?
3 day week at work and then #Playgroup festival!! Gonna be grand :)
I can't believe I paid good money to acquire this hangover :s #painful
Only the thought of girls night out is going to be able to drag me through this diaster of a day
Oh dear. There goes pretty much all my money in one weekend. And now here begins the life of a hermit.
RIP Amy Winehouse. A deserved member of the 27 Club I feel. Today is a sad day.
@official_sarc Too right!! What the devil is going on?!
15 days until Playgroup Festival is upon us!!! #excited!!
Mid point has been reached, the end is in sight, and the smile has returned to my face :)
Rainy Mondays are definately not what it is all about. Certainly not.
Gemma has returned to Twitter!! Insert witty comment here :)
I am raising my glass to you today dad.  I hope you are happy where ever you are.  Happy Father's Day.
@KT_Snaydon Oh sweetie, we all know that your love it strong. There is no need to fight it any longer, no one will judge ;) x
@KT_Snaydon Welcome to the world of Twitter my dear!!  Are you following Mr Danny DeVito yet?  :)
Oh a-cursed sleep, how you continue to foil me. Boo hiss I do declare, I shall defeat you yet!
Two of my heroes passed away in one week. It is a bad time to be liked by me it seems. RIP both xx
Please. Help the needy today. Send cupcakes. To me. Thank you.
So this is purgatory - waiting an hour to pick up some perscription meds on a sunny day. Boo.
Cheese and port makes for a very happy Gemma. This is going to be a mighty fine eve!
@Dirt89 Well I, errr, used to. That may change since meeting you :)
Why oh why is it the fat and/or ugly people choose to bare all in the sun first? We don't need to see that!!
@stuwalsall I can explain it in five: D R U G S.
@Dirt89 You also have a slightly chubby ear.
@Dirt89 We had lots and lots of sex. It was hot. He gives the best head ever. Just for the record ;)
Tonight's topic of conversation - hamster related sex toys. Not too sure what happened there...
The sun is out! The time for frolicking is nigh :)
Wandering through cloudy marshmellow fields of dreams and sleepiness...
I don't think that even a coffee filled IV drip could save me now....
@stuwalsall I have my moments of greatest it must be said. And next for the roast!! :)
Breakfast date with @stuwalsall. Perfect way to start a day :)
@galadarling You are very rapidly becoming one of my icons.  I think that you are truly fabulous!
@Dirt89 I love the way we have already been paired off here.  I think this could get interesting :)
Casual sexual encounters are turning into a long forgotten art form. This saddens me.
After a lovely weekend of lying in bed, music, friends and alcohol, back to work we go. Oh joy.
I want my serotonin back!! Please! You are being rather mean, oh cruel body of mine :(
The aim of this game is to control your very destiny...
Really need to start high fiving after sex more. Way to make everybody's day! :)
@_PATRICK_WOLF  Oh wow, I almost fell off my chair when you walked on stage at the Patti Smith at Bexhill show last night. Just amazing!!!
Procrastination only seems to be getting me so far. How frightfully disappointing!
Not to excited about the prospect of arriving home to an empty home after the busy festive season. Oh dear.
Final day of calm before festive choas rains down upon my head... I may savour this moment with something mulled :)
Excessive dancing last night has resulted in severe bad ache today. I need to get me a massage.
Kissing is like shaking hands but with tongues :-)
My heart hurts
What happened to good old plain black wooly jumpers? No zips. No stupidly huge collars. No stupid embelishment. Too much for a girl to ask??
Looking forward to a weekend of celebrating birthdays, and grown up meals. If only my new dresses had arrived ready for the ocassion....
Finding it very difficult to cope with the stupidity shown on a regular basis by many of the idoits I have the misfortune to work with.

Beautiful sunrise this morning. That is one benefit of getting up this early each day, right there :-)
Day one of making the world a better place one day at a time. Not too sure how to get this started though...
currently contemplating the wonders of gin....

Got the feeling that this week is going to be lllooooonnngggggg...... :-(
I love my beautiful new tattoo.  It is amazing!!  Thinking of making it into a half sleeve now... :)
The realisation of how delicious my goat cheese and red pepper quiche for lunch is gonna be has made me so thankful not be a vegan anymore!
Hmmm.... What I wouldn't do to still be lounging around in bed today......
@Ozzy_Lee_2009 Hi there!! How the devil are you?  And now you are able to listen (well, read) my most intimate thoughts! Aren't you lucky?!
@dktrlewis let me follow you!!  I want to see how life in France is treating you! :)
I am going to blown into the sea!! So windy today!! Shall make sure to eat as many forms of potato and cheese as in case of my last meal
Volunteering to work on a Sunday may not be the most intelligent idea I ever did have...
Just been asked by a creepy guy at train station how to get the train to paradise. Which appaently resides in my eyes. Aren't I lucky?!
Today is going to be a long long day. And what is that tickle in my throat? Oh fabulous. Good morning cold!!
Finally managed to get a photo up on this damn thing.  I feel like I am down with the kids now or something :)
When does it become time to be the bigger person and bite the bullet. Families will never be fun :-(
Rising this early is never going to be a good feeling. Shower and then coffee, oh yes.
Hi Twitter. My name is Gemma. Very pleased to finally meet you ;-)
