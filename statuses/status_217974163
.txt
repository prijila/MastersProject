@InsideDestiny @itssKJ yeah.someone forgot their video-making etiquette
@InsideDestiny @Logan_FITU he removed the video?
@InsideDestiny @itssKJ yeah, but those are two issues. What if he didn't monetize it? Would you still be really mad?
@itssKJ @InsideDestiny then again, if he knows those weapons are good...you're right, he should have just done the clips himself
@Logan_FITU @InsideDestiny I can agree with that
@itssKJ @InsideDestiny well maybe he likes to just make videos of top X stuff.
@Logan_FITU @InsideDestiny about that you may be right. Maybe this guy meant to take credit. People deserve the benefit of the doubt tho
#TGwS anyone up for some Battlefront 2 sometime today?
@InsideDestiny unfortunately in this digital age, stealing is ever quite that simple.
@InsideDestiny but that's me. Maybe I'm weird :) sorry this guy upset u, tho
@InsideDestiny I would be flattered. Then I would reach out to make sure I got cited
@InsideDestiny he should have cited you, I just don't think it's stealing. If someone took a video I made and put it in their top 10...
@InsideDestiny it's a top 10. Most top 10 videos anywhere are made up of clips not used by the original maker
@InsideDestiny maybe I'm confused. I understand giving you recognition for the clip, but this isn't a simple gameplay video.

First break in my 12 hour day. Then home to mix it up in AC #TGwS http://t.co/NwUT9Q2YfA
RT @DarisanHurston: @Ironmanfaf yes! Plus, You CANT go wrong with 2 turrets :-) oh AC 2.0 is going to be fun!!
@Astrology80750 um...no thanks. That's not what I was talking about. #THwS
@DarisanHurston ya. I was looking at the Taurus, but then realized it can't be upgraded much to be like the others. So Andromeda it is #TGwS
@Versecast added a couple of u. Will do the rest later. Sleepy time now. Tomorrow work from 7:30-7:30
@DarisanHurston @Versecast especially after I get my Constellation

@TheOnlyJonto hey man! Applied to the org. Hoping to have a great time with you guys #THWS
@daboulsiwek @DarisanHurston apparently, u get a hornet to use in AC if u get a constellation
@daboulsiwek @DarisanHurston well I'm concerned cause I'm considering selling my avenger and getting a Constellation
@daboulsiwek @DarisanHurston how does it compare to the Hornet?
@daboulsiwek @DarisanHurston so how did u feel about it?
@DarisanHurston yeah. My buddy has the 325. He said it's awesome
So I have an Avenger in #StarCitizen right now. Is there a better dogfighting ship to use for the same price or lower? #ArenaCommander
Now for a quick break from #StarCitizen to try out my newly modded #Skyrim @RobertsSpaceInd @ElderScrolls
Work around aside, #StarCitizen is awesome! Buggy (as expected), but awesome! @RobertsSpaceInd

Life can be a tricky thing. Especially when all you've ever known is one thing, but God wants you to do another.
I guess its time for a life change. Almost 4 years of constantly being so close to somebody, then to have it all end... Quite a transition.
Back to the old grind. :-)
That was an unpleasant flight.... But I can't really say I've ever had a pleasant one...
At the gate. See u soon, Lakeland.
