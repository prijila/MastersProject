theres no way that another band can affect me as much as @TheBlackout have.
their music inspires me and helps me through all the bad times!!
Even now listening to the blackout makes me so happy their music fills me with adrenaline and i could cry every time i listen to them

Insulting @TheBlackout is insulting me!
why can't people just accept that I like my music and that insulting my favourite band will automatically make me despise you -_-
jessi j and nicki manaj should be bottled at T in the park. Their music is a crime -_-
