@Joanne_Powell I was meant to be at one of those this evening but Ivan didn't get in until gone 8 and it started at 7!!
@joanne_powell oh no couldn't do that - is our own fault as she thinks she is a cat and comes in and out! you got off Canvey ok then!!
oh dear the rabbit has chewed through Ivan's laptop power lead - I am surprised she didn't have sparks as it was plugged in - oops!
right lets get a move on!!
my two day headache has finally left me - must be stressing about something! @joanne_powell think I have put on the weight you have lost!
think I will go back to bed - this day had started really badly and it isn't even 9 o'clock yet
@joanne_powell you just wouldn't do it would you? The lady in question is you and me put together & is getting married next yr -no willpower
wonders why someone would put on facebook that they have lost 2lbs @ fat club & then in the next breathe say they have eaten a galaxy-crazy?
@Simon_Powell feeling better then?!  We didn't go anywhere in the end yesterday just popped over the road for a BBQ in the evening!

tension is building - we find out tomorrow at 9.15 what the big news is at work - ooh can't wait - whatever!!
Ethan rode his bike today without stablisers and you would have thought he had been doing it for years - where did he learn that!!

@richardpbacon my 5 year old can unlock my nokia don't agree with them having phones did we when we were kids?
@joanne_powell do you know why the rabbit died?
