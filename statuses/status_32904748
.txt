Busy day all over the place sorting out for Sunday

Just home from Burnham-still trying to figure out how the car ended up crashed that way round! Probably most exciting thing to happen there!
another exciting day in the Dengie - Wine Tasting tonight at Burnham Golf Club woohoo!
Watched flash forward didn't grip me yesterday as wasn't in mood but got into it tonight got me thinking!
@Joanne_Powell probably a bit late for tea but a nice jacket with cheese and prawns mmmm - I had soup and am still hungry!!
wonders what has happened to @simon_powell any ideas @joanne_powell???
@Joanne_Powell you been drinking??!!
@Joanne_Powell I was meant to be at one of those this evening but Ivan didn't get in until gone 8 and it started at 7!!
@joanne_powell oh no couldn't do that - is our own fault as she thinks she is a cat and comes in and out! you got off Canvey ok then!!
oh dear the rabbit has chewed through Ivan's laptop power lead - I am surprised she didn't have sparks as it was plugged in - oops!
right lets get a move on!!
my two day headache has finally left me - must be stressing about something! @joanne_powell think I have put on the weight you have lost!
think I will go back to bed - this day had started really badly and it isn't even 9 o'clock yet
@joanne_powell you just wouldn't do it would you? The lady in question is you and me put together & is getting married next yr -no willpower
wonders why someone would put on facebook that they have lost 2lbs @ fat club & then in the next breathe say they have eaten a galaxy-crazy?
@Simon_Powell feeling better then?!  We didn't go anywhere in the end yesterday just popped over the road for a BBQ in the evening!
hi ho hi ho it's off to Maldon we go!
just back from Rayleigh opticians went well for Ethan and I - Ivan stayed at home and cleaned the house.  What to watch on tv tonight....
@Simon_Powell wow won't recognise you!!  Do you feel better for it? @joanne_powell men seems to lose it quicker than women - show offs!!
just waiting for dinner to finish cooking - one big lasagne, glad the freezer is working again so won't have to have it two nights running!!
@joanne_Powell interpret that which ever way takes your fancy!
@joanne_Powell well done! Going at it steady helps to keep it off-good on you x
Just climbed into bed. Ivan has done something to his knee so bought a Bose system for the touch?!

@joanne_powell now that is wishful thinking! nearly popped in 4 coffee yesterday your car was on the drive but I needed to get 2 Tillingham!
@Simon_Powell oh well we could try that not sure they will buy it though - worth a try = cheapest I got it was £19
tension is building - we find out tomorrow at 9.15 what the big news is at work - ooh can't wait - whatever!!
Ethan rode his bike today without stablisers and you would have thought he had been doing it for years - where did he learn that!!
@wossy do not give up your day job - cricket is definitely not your thing!!!
I so don't want to do cricket tea tomorrow - let it rain oh please let it rain!!!
@richardpbacon I did that for my 1st marriage and had the reverand preaching for 45 minutes about god-we are not religious so what is point?
@wearebutlins we thought Ocean Hotel was fresh and vibrant although still a few teething problems with lifts etc. Staff very friendly-thanks
@joanne_powell thank you. Maybe it will improve his behaviour! Have fun at work, I think I would struggle getting back into it after 6 weeks

@joanne_Powell only got Ethan some school shoes. Had lunch at Sloppy's didn't think it would be too busy.....
just back from Colchester couldn't wait for freezer man - left Ivan to come home and deal with it!
Ethan wants to go to Sloppy Joes for food.......
waiting for freezer repair man to ring to say what time he is arriving then we can go shopping - so much for phoning first thing?!

@simon_powell you might not say it out loud but am sure you thought it!  We have a sofa bed you can sleep on and get a train from Kelvedon!
@simon_powell so no work then if no trains running!
@joanne_powell same with me used the dyson again - just a phase I think!!
Just climbing into bed following morning at squash and rest of day at friends house for BBQ - thank you x
Sorry that's the American in me!

off to Ipswich this afternoon.  Ethan back home and full of energy - joy!
oh where have half my followers gone!?
@joanne_powell our rabbit thinks she is a cat and comes in and out of the house - she launches herself onto the sofa !
house is quiet without the little man - am sure it isn't quiet elsewhere!  Off to bed now - goodnight one and all x
Ethan up dressed and ready for a week at Nanny's!
@simon_powell lounge too small for 47" if we could knock through to next door would be ok! Ivan thought I went round the furniture-whatever!
just finished vaxing the lounge carpet - my the tv looks small from the dining area!  Don't think will go out now is windy
Laying in bed still! Off to birthday party in Braintree later. Will there be cricket today????
@joanne_powell joy of working for a school at least you save on childcare! Time will fly I am sure!
is watching this morning between cleaning the house.
@simon_powell mmmm wonders what that something was that you pulled!!!
where haven't I been today?
@Simon_Powell the flu line said that I didn't have all the symptoms so prob just summer cold or something?
Not swine flu as not got temperature!
@Simon_Powell not looking bad for five to six in the morning! Just getting up now and look a wreck!
@Simon_Powell just done swine flu checker and says to call doctors-great!
off to bed now - nose still blocked up and throat sore.  Obviously spent too much time in Burnham last week!!

@simon_powell filled boot with shopping from Sainsburys.  Dyson went on back seats.  Will get an iphone one day!
Off to Chelmsford to buy a Dyson.  Ivan gone to cricket again.......  Not sure what else I will fit in my car but we will see!!
Booked holiday to Turkey today wouldn't have happened if he hadn't gone to cricket!
Not impressed as Ivan is playing cricket today AND tomorrow :(
@Simon_Powell well got a sore throat and a really runny nose and keep sneezing. Think Ivan gave it to me!
Had a pleasant day in Burnham.  Nice curry for dinner wth a bottle of wine - off up to bed now but seem to have aquired a cold boohoo!
I am wondering what the boys will surprise me with tomorrow! Burnham better be sunny there for the day!

aha Mrs Powell must have finished the packed lunches!!  Think Ivan is upstairs making the bed - nice clean bedding!  Got a bit burnt today!
@simon_powell sort of furniture cream and walls three different colours.  Don;t know how to do pics on here!
no I do not have a foot fetish! Your walls are the colour of our carpet!  Our lounge not big enough for tv on wall :(
@simon_powell nice toes!
just think that squash is as exciting as the tennis!!
I don't think Murray is going to win
and I thought my house was a mess!!  Ivan says glad BBq outside!!  Nice cat also :)  Ah but does husband make the coffee???
jelly beans have more sugar than raisins!  could do with some chocolate though!!
husband just made me a coffee..... ah bit tricky with no kitchen!!
eating raisins, watching the tennis and doing a bit of surfing all at the same time!
@realmattlucas so what do we have to look forward to?
Watching the tennis!
cat on lap and boys gone off to colts.  What an exciting life one has!
? @simon_powell the heat getting to you? I think he was already dead and it was a double for the concert with a plan to make some money...
Going to close my eyes and go to sleep now ;)
ooh play again tomorrow and you may get five out of five!
@richardpbacon my 5 year old can unlock my nokia don't agree with them having phones did we when we were kids?
@joanne_powell do you know why the rabbit died?
well Mr @simon_powell that would be rather generous of you shame Ivan not on here you would put him to shame!  Have you a date yet for BBQ?
wonder who the winner was at squash eh Simon!!  I want an Iphone my birthday is in two weeks if anyone is feeling generous needs to be 16g!
sitting on here when I should be getting ready for work!
