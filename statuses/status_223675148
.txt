@Laura_Liverbird hopefully the home game. Goin this Friday woo hoo ha
@Laura_Liverbird haha. Just hope we play better next wk in semis. Pepe needs a good kick up arse aswell
@Laura_Liverbird my Nan could have that pass completion cos he only passes sideways n 1 yard passes. Anyway I'm sure we'll improve next wk
@Kopite_Chris78 "racist" headline. Too right he should. Id sue that little prick aswel. Scumbag inbred manc twat
RT @Kopite_Chris78: Oh and if I was Suarez I'd also be suing all the newspapers that ran with the headline Racist..
@Laura_Liverbird I honestly don't think we are. Spearo doin just as good a job. He just needs more games. I'm still to be convinced by Lucas
@AJohno_11 not that u deserved to win 3-0. Was never a pen. But let's see if yous have the balls to keep goin n stop them bastards makin 20
@Laura_Liverbird same here. I hope he does. People seem to forget bout Lucas. They all bloody love him now. I still don't. Just not a fan
@Laura_Liverbird no he shudnt. Out of his depth. Kenny shud av got it. As for Rafa. He blew it big time. Had the best team in 08/09 n fkd up
@begsylfc only against us it seems!! Fergies Association
RT @begsylfc: Manager waving for red card, player diving to win penalty. Thought FA were stamping on things like that!!!
@Laura_Liverbird I thrive to see 4-4-2 formation. Some1 who'll give Carroll the support he needs. Can't keep blamin him. Not his fault
@Laura_Liverbird I wanted Rafa out. That cunt lost the fuckin plot. He's the reason y we play 1 up top. Cos he only bort to fit that 4mation
RT @Robbie9Fowler: Struggling to find any positives tonight..... The fact city have gone 3 pts clear of Man u is the only one I can think of
RT @Kopite_Chris78: I'll take a defeat tonight for a win over 2 legs and a trip to Wembley..
#RIPGARYABLETT
Needed city to win there. Keep them fuckin inbred fuckers quiet a bit longer. Then the mighty reds beat them on tues n NUFC beat scum wed
