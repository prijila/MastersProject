I would argue most piracy were once local fisherman, factory trawlers indiscriminatingly raping oceans #outlawocean  https://t.co/j2HMDoUfL5

@OCEANUSLive there are all the reasons in the world "why not" &amp; its complex. Maybe make UN or new single body manage ocean laws #outlawocean
@INPROL They help as so far as they are actually enforced/recognized which mostly they are not. No political or economic will #outlawocean
So 1st issue is to get countries actually agree to abide by their laws, boundaries which won't happen cause resource interests #OutlawOcean
4 instance Japan doesn't recognize Australia's claim re Antarctica re Whaling sanctuary. Without a navy to enforce will ignore #OutlawOcean
Also being there are usually disputes between countries where economic zones versus territorial zones are cause issues too #OutlawOcean
#OutlawOcean We have all the required laws in the Sea just not the political or economical will to enforce them re environmental laws
