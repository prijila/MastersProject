Dear Comic-Con gods, please tell me I put the iPad charging cord in the checked luggage, cause it sure ain't in the carry-on...
@Kosherart me too!!!! I wonder who the other three are!!!
@Emmaleigh504 isn't she?! and super sweet. I miss her. I've been gone about five hours. üò£
@MalnurturedSnay she moved in last December - formerly lived underneath the neighbor's porch.
@house_of_darkly you're there already!
@Laurathefierce I bet it's Blake
I miss this little booper already. At least she's not home alone. http://t.co/4Vb77v7kZi

@Laurathefierce well ignore me then! I definitely didn't go to it, anyway. ^_^

@Kosherart exactly. so now there's a second copy - probably sent to Sam? But also the Styne's totally have it.
@Kosherart at the VERY least simply reformatting the hard drive would be a bigger obstacle than smashing the case.
@Kosherart 2) but also she'd have some killer software meant to erase data 99.999999% for good.
@Kosherart The real Charlie would 1) have some kickass encryption already, which a family with the Styne's resources could eventually crack
@Kosherart Smashing the case - and that's another point, Charlie's going to have a military-grade machine - delays them for like an hour.
@Kosherart The data is still easily accessible on her hard drive. All they have to do is take it out and pop it into another machine.
Guys, the REAL Charlie would never secure her data by *smashing her laptop against a sink* . That's not a thing. #Supernatural

@Ugh_itsErin @kerrold http://t.co/EW9oNl731C
@Ugh_itsErin @kerrold books?! who reads books anymore? ;-)
I have no idea where @Ugh_itsErin is but I'm watching #TVD S5 E21 without her. Livetweeting commencing! I'm so sorry, Tweeple!
@kerrold @Ugh_itsErin ... or did I??!? (Yes. I did.)
@kerrold @Ugh_itsErin Who's ready for some VD tonight!?!?!
@gfitzp depends on her mood! She's been getting attention from Big Scary Per for the last four hours so she may be done socializing. :-/
Two 15-minute waits at outdoors #wmata stations. It's 23F. I may never warm up.
@Patrixmyth not according to @Patrol_Kitty... for her a meal isn't truly satisfying unless it's fleeing in terror...
Oops, I almost ordered bacon! Forgot I've been dead-mammal-free for a month.
You know who *didn't* get possessed by a traveler? Klaus. #TVD
PLEASE let Grams cross over from the other side! #TVD can only be better with Jasmine Guy. Whitley Gilbert is the best Gilbert.
@kerrold I don't think there will be scars this time.
Brief intermission to tend to Home Depot wounds, again.
I've been semi-shunned by @Patrol_Kitty all day. Not sure what I did...
And the witches would be like "oh yeah we don't remember why we did that any way, here ya go." #TVD
I *still* don't understand why the travelers don't just say "hey witches, can you lift this stupid curse?" #TVD
Stefan, you're really bad at not being suspicious. #TVD
OK, that episode was kind of blah. On to S5 E20, last one for tonight. What Lies Beneath - sounds like a feel-good episode. #TVD
I've said this before but if I was Bonnie in S5 I would be drunk all the time. Ugh. #TVD
Whatever happened to Silas? Is he still riding around on a bus, decomposing? #TVD
"Augh! Vervain!" is to #TVD as "*sniff sniff* Sulfur!" is to #SPN.
@dwhren yeah, that's what @kerrold keeps telling me so I'm slogging through. :)
@dwhren Haha. It's not actively bad, I guess, but it's a mess and I have trouble caring.
OR he's looking for Boone's sister, Maggie Grace!!! I swear this makes sense somewhere in my head. #TVD
Starting to put this together - Enzo is looking for Maggie. Now, he either means Bela from Supernatural, who is now fighting zombies... #TVD
I mean Damon. (Once a character on LOST, always a character on LOST.) #TVD
.@Patrol_Kitty is purring loudly in the corner but she's not watching because Boone hasn't appeared yet. #TVD
I wish I had two boyfriends I could just bounce back and forth between whenever i have a fight with one. #TVD (No, not really, sweetie.)
@Ugh_itsErin @kerrold NOT TOMORROW NIGHT EITHER BECAUSE I HAVE STUPID STATS CLASS.
@kerrold @Ugh_itsErin OK I WILL LET YOU KNOW BEFORE I GET THERE. NOT TONIGHT.
So here goes. #TVD S5 E19: Man on Fire. I forget if I'm supposed to be on the side of the Travelers or the witches. Witches, right? Maybe?
Guys, I'm sorry, but I have strict orders from @Ugh_itsErin and @kerrold to livetweet my viewings of The Vampurr Diaries S5 E19-22. #TVD
@Ugh_itsErin Now!!!
Friendly reminder that I need a hotel buddy for #SDCC. I have a crappy room booked, hoping to upgrade in the mad scramble...

Klaus isn't as cool as Constantine though.
