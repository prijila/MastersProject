GG NZ, great tournament. Deserved! Well played the French. #RWC2011
I don't agree with this time wasting bollocks tho NZ, either play or don't play. Crappy end :( #RWC2011
Good grief this is tense. Seriously, this is mental. Could go either way! #RWC2011
Christ, kicking not the highlight of the final. Still, NZ looking like they're wobbling. Surely they can't lose right? #RWC2011
French lead? Surely not.... #RWC2011

@ArcathWhitefall ........ shit.
@marktrance101 @_Cr4zy I want it just to do graphics on, not for playing games! It's not gonna happen tho :(
I want a mac :(
Even when utterly slaughtered, @matwebb manages to nail his "Hey Baby" stare for the camera:   http://yfrog.com/h36bqmgj

@PaulChaloner rofl, DONT MOVE A MUSCLE :P Shinobi was win & didn't break your golden rule of Matrix music in frag movies ;)
Back from Prague. Holy crap what a trip. Photo's & stories to come. Kudos to @davidonionball for organising & @matwebb for surviving!
Landed in a sunny Amsterdam, waiting for connecting flight to Prague. Free airport WIFI! Need breakfast tho. Onwards!
At Birmingham Airport, about to head to Amsterdam, then Prague! Far too early tho. Full English required!
That wasn't a joke btw, it appears they actually do. There is also a different age system in Korea -  http://j.mp/6vetT
From @davexilly: "In Eastern Outer Mongolia, age is traditionally determined based on the number of full moons since conception..."
@Mohunky I hear you. Iv gone for the sugary, milky, builders coffee today though. 3 hours then it's onward to Prague baby! \o/
The only thing scarier than radiation is the ignorance on display here. Truly epic ignorance I might add:  http://j.mp/gnYesM

Ah look! Only this afternoon to go and then it's off to Prague for the weekend with @philjf1 & @matwebb. A well deserved break I feel!
A very productive day with the #iseries stage team yesterday, however I managed to get myself sun-burnt. In march. *sigh

Oh hello Twitter! How I have missed you this week! The end of all this hard work is in sight tho, #fbl is imminent! Seriously need a drink.
See you in three hours: http://j.mp/gwIgwR
Need to make sure I order some currency for the Prague trip next week, nearly ordered Euro's last week for it! That would have been... fail.
Listening to the TRON soundtrack again today after a month or so without listening to it. It's 37 different types of awesome.
It's all work this week, so I have been neglecting the usual channels of communication. Normal service will be resumed soon. Now tho, bed!

When you're building a site, and it's been essentially bare bones for weeks, the slightest bit of actual working dev is overtly exciting ;p
Seriously not impressed with how quickly the last 3 days have gone :/ #needmoartime
@KharneUK what you bought dude?
Keep looking, you'll see it in a sec http://j.mp/aoV5IV
@slanty09 awesome! I promise I won't drop you much. That said, we've gotta test it right? ;p
@MPLAY_Wizzo I'm fairly sure the plan calls for me to have topped myself by that point, so we'll plan to re-schedule that one if it's ok?
The next hour will be spent planning how I'm going to plan the plan, in order to get a working plan completed like we planned. #plan
@philjf1 awesome! All bets are still on as to the sex right? I'm feeling quids in already ;D
This morning has been all about more Minecraft designs. Something cool in the works....

@reapercore @AnouilhUK well at least I've got it to look forward to, assuming I get to play it while there's still breath in me
This kinda thing is infuriating, can they not see that it's costing them money? This is a prime example of why games get pirated. Seriously.
FFS why does Bulletstorm not unlock on Steam till 9pm tonight?! If I had a boxed copy I cud be PLAYING IT NOW. It negates the fucking point!
Made it onto #abduzeedo again yesterday! Cheers guys :) http://flic.kr/p/9kiB46
