@lhanam @kylemarshesq I don't think that just being a union necessarily encourages unity #NUTchat
@Bedtonman @LHanam Yes, that is a different can of worms. One I hope to never have to open #NUTchat
@Bedtonman @LHanam Strikes have to be meaningful and not grate with public opinion, a fine line right now #NUTchat
@LHanam But no Academy is bound to any of the working practices for teachers, something the Unions use as their bread and butter #NUTchat
@LHanam I think it is arguable to say that Unions would have all Academies reverted to LEAs if they could, under the old frameworks #NUTchat
@LHanam If we had had an all powerful teaching union, Academies would be dead in the water (they are a good thing) #NUTchat
@MissCranky That would have to depend on your definition of progress
Whilst I am for professional unity, it has to be said that a single powerful union could well stand in the way of progress #NUTchat

@kylemarshesq @MattArdenna I retain my stance.
@kylemarshesq @MattArdenna I just signed a petition calling for her resignation ;-)
@kylemarshesq @MattArdenna for a position like that, public face is paramount. Brain developed or otherwise, I would have her gone.
@kylemarshesq @MattArdenna she cannot have her cake and eat it
@kylemarshesq @MattArdenna if she is not one of those, why does she hold her position then?
@kylemarshesq @MattArdenna it's all relative, would you employ a teacher with a prison sentence for hate speech a decade earlier?
@kylemarshesq @MattArdenna but for her position, which is a paid one, it is unacceptable.

@kylemarshesq I.e. virtual. Is biology an illusion of chemistry? Higher conceptualisation I would say.
@kylemarshesq it is a virtual place / space. A multitude thereof. A virtual multiverse if you will.
