@masterbarberuk I always forget when you work. Fridays are good for me, otherwise when is good for you? Ill pm.

@woodpunk There is a sci-fi short story about a guy that builds a replicator machine. Might have been Ray Bradbury story. Forgot how it ends

@jonronson My pal @WillPCooper tells me it was a great night. I hope he wasn't embarrassingly fawning when he met you.

@peasmoldia Same time zone. Came out Friday morning, back late Tuesday. Quite bohemian.
@scissors_golden @masterbarberuk In Marrakech. Had a cut throat shave. 'New Blade' (yeah). If I snuff it you get the black car!
@peasmoldia One side of the city is almost medieval, the other side like somewhere in southern Europe. Jemaa El Fna very full on.
@peasmoldia I'm in Marrakech! Had a mad day today. Went to the Tanneries. Poaaibly the worst job in the world. Had a cut throat shave too!

@peasmoldia Did you ever see Gods School report in the 'Monty Python Paperbok' from back in the day?
@peasmoldia Have you ever read any Christopher Hitchens? Like Dawkins but more vitriolic. You'd enjoy it if you've not done so already.

@peasmoldia I was asking all those q's. Should have just looked at your website! You were part of my youth! Friday nights on the new C4.
@peasmoldia Basically Benny loved women (not physically), but couldn't talk about it. Russell loves women and can't stop talking about it.
@frankhamo NO2
@peasmoldia Interesting take on him as an individual, and his work compared to say Russell Brand. (vocal womaniser, good verbal skills).
For retro arcade geeks; http://t.co/iQLQBdvYoB
@peasmoldia Did you see this months GQ about starting off in comedy? Interesting. And an interesting retrospective on Benny Hill.
@peasmoldia Respect. Perhaps a second career beckons for me? Does it pay well, have a pension and private health care?
https://t.co/T95PUxvQfh @jonronson You made it to the statue...its good isn't it?
@peasmoldia Do you write and perform, or write for others? I cherish a rejected letter from Spitting Image for a sketch I submitted when 15!
@peasmoldia All respect to you. I always wanted to but went off into corporate land, where the ability to make people smile or laugh helps.
@peasmoldia Shit, you don't write for Ricky Gervais do you? Huge apologies if you do!
@trent_dan @PistonHeads Lots Of Trouble, Usually Serious (that came off the forum a while ago and made me smile).
@peasmoldia Its amazing, just never saw anything of theirs growing up. I'll try and pick some up. Do you write?
@peasmoldia Imagine Python in one studio, Milligan in the next, and Cook as 'Godfather'. Golden. Think I know all Derek and Clive by heart.
@peasmoldia You know I've never watched any Laurel and Hardy.
@peasmoldia I like Russell Brand. Chris Morris. Radio era Alan Partridge. Cook and Moore. Some not all Python. Spike Milligan.
@peasmoldia I missed that one, but heard it was good. The one where his Dad turned up and he told him to F*** Off. Loved it.
@peasmoldia Exactly. Who do you rate then?
@peasmoldia The guys I do like are Lee Mack, and Stewart Lee. Its nothing to do with Lee. They work hard on the material.
@peasmoldia Not watched enough Jimmy Carr to comment (probably says enough), Michael Mackintyre is a 'Mums favourite', again I never watch.
@peasmoldia OK, is it controversial that I think everything Ricky Gervais does is crap? Sneering, lazy, exploitative. A one colour rainbow.
@peasmoldia Agreed. I think we have a lot of ground to cover. Lets start at the beginning. Do you think Charlie Chaplin is funny?
@peasmoldia Top Cat. Sergeant Bilko. Discuss.
@DorkingMayor @leatherheadnews @frankhamo I only just got the 'feline jealous' gag.

@TomWestcott @pedalandspokesc No it's a piston heads track day. My brother in law us bringing his 964 targa too.
@TomWestcott @pedalandspokesc Cool. Thank you. It's for inside the car at Goodwood. I owe you one.
@TomWestcott @pedalandspokesc Either of you have one of those action cams I could use? Track day in Dec. Will buy car mount for you n return
Onslow Clandon last night for dinner. Too many chips, so brought them back for the pigs who have just scoffed them for breakkie.
@Cllr_JaneBrophy @neil_taylor_ and hello back!
Enjoying a Peroni At The Onslow Arms.
@007 A moon buggy with weird arms #007frangrances
@thedailymash Nice angle.
@SurreyRoadCops Step aside Sir.
@jonronson Or Jonathan King.
@SurreyRoadCops @cookdnbombd Embarrassed silence. Looked pretty nice.
@SurreyRoadCops what is it? Beemer? Lexus?
@Robin_Leach @pennjillette Expect Rabbit out of the bag.
@007 10 #007fragrances
@007 #007frangrances In a plane
@007 Rolls Royce
Surely Paul Flowers (ex Co-Op) has all the qualifications needed to run for mayor of Toronto?
RT @SurreyRoadCops: @GavinCritchley I think we can do more than offer just a visit to the nick. We leave that privilege to our criminal fri…
@SurreyRoadCops Would love to see that conversation. "Do you want to come and see our police station?"....."Errrrr...."
@SurreyRoadCops Invite? You do not have to attend, but it may harm your twitter account if you do not attend if invited!
@007 Never say never....http://t.co/TkFawQZboa
@jonronson http://t.co/hk11hts2jM
@jonronson Ray Gosling died Jon :-(
@007 A road tanker?
@007 Who didn't play this on Nintendo 64?
@SurreyRoadCops I see HGV's on shoulder out of tacho hours sometimes. What do you do with them? Seems tough either way.
RT @paulresearch: Cold rain hammering down all evening from a black sky. Love it.
Lovely Monday night with new friends @theabingerhatch   All good!
@007 The Helicopter that was chasing him
@jonronson Considering how weird it is, its not made the major TV networks just yet.
@thedailymash Blackadder, Series 2, where he falls for his 'manservant' - Bob. The trip to the Doctor.
@paulresearch Must be better than with the shockingly bad KLM?
@pedalandspokesc @Myson_Davies @TheWilliamBray I agree, the Bray is fantastic too. The Onslow Arms in Clandon good if heading to the A3.
@007 And the Opera scene was good. Gemma Arterton excellent. As for the rest....Meh.
@007 Quantum has a fantastic opening shot, the long one across the lake. Guess boat chase done on the Thames somewhere. Tilbury?
@Myson_Davies The Hatch is fab since new crowd took over. Hope the same can happen at the Hurtwood. @pedalandspokesc
@SurreyRoadCops if it's dead not sure I have a problem with that. Any law broken?
Excellent lunch @theabingerhatch . Busy but lots of staff and good service. Lamb shoulder v good. Well done. @TheGuildfordMag
Car wash in aid of The Phillipines at the King William Little London this morning.
@SurreyRoadCops I love the A3 tunnel. Those LED lane markers...its like being in Tron.
@UKVolkswagen Scirblocko.
@SurreyRoadCops Would blend in perfectly around Cobham and Virginia Water.
@paulresearch Tubular Bells was classic. We can forgive the Blue Peter theme I hope?
@paulresearch and it's a long walk from A to E.
@PistonHeads As I'm red-green colour blind it all looks the same to me.
RT @WillPCooper: it says a lot about our world that children can starve and somebody buys a painting for $135,000,000
@WillPCooper NIRVANA.
@WillPCooper Yes and state controlled galleries. Powerful pictures of men and women working, a hammer in one hand and a sickle in the other
@WillPCooper I know. But £4 for a cup of coffee! How much must it cost to make? Like 50p?
@WillPCooper Its was a triptych, so technically 3 paintings on panels. People spend £4 on a pint or a cup of coffee.
@jonronson You are living the dream Jon!
Nice pint @TheWilliamBray last night. Love that Peroni Azzurro. They had the wood burner on too. Warm and chilled at the same time.
@BBCBreaking You probably start off with a sleeping bag....then its downhill from there. Honestly, nothing suspicious at all.
@007 How cool?
@paulresearch don't wanna be a richer man
http://t.co/YSM6ID96BU Always said Dorking was a great place to shop...me and @maryportas agree. @scissors_golden @VintageShrewd !!!!
@trent_dan My sister worked for Avis in Manchester Piccadilly, and brought a new one home every weekend. She used to disconnect the speedo.
@jonronson Hammer Time!
@SurreyRoadCops just seen you at J10 A3 incident. Your unmarked car shifted me out if the way promptly!
@thedailymash Fantastic idea.
@TomWestcott The clever thing is to acknowledge your strengths, but also to be able to 'play' in other roles too.
@TomWestcott Yes they are used all over the corporate world to 'define' what kind of person you are. English-Nice-Type-Petrolhead,
@paulresearch Turn and face the strain.
@SurreyRoadCops Not a criticism. Just acknowledging that the M25 is a big road, any time, any day. Closing it (even partially) is a big call
@SurreyRoadCops Closing the M25 on a Sunday night J10-11.....that is some call to make.
@paulresearch Ch, ch, cha cha changes.........
@neil_taylor_ You were spoiled by the Co-op?
Great lunch as always at the Onslow in Clandon. Very recommended. @TheGuildfordMag
@laurenbeukes @paulresearch I'd enjoy the Donkey Geyser. I've known a few Diamond Geezers, so a Donkey one would make a change.
Great evening watching Charlie and the chocolate factory in the West End.
