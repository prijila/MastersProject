New books aren't selling well instantly? Frak it then--cancel 'em &amp; throw them a Frank Miller bone. That'll fix everything!
(2/2) DC is always looking for the magic instant solution, instead of doing boring things like long-term development of creators &amp; IP
DC expecting Dark Knight III to save them financially is mistaking the symptom for the cure (1/2)
Best part? This will be the 3rd or 4th "housecleaning" that somehow sees DiDio/Lee/Johns keep their positions. Always someone else's fault.
And the (alleged) abandoning of DCYou after less then 3 full months pretty much shows that no one's actually in charge--just continuous CYA.
I mean, $2 million? That's a rounding error in Batman v. Superman budget. But let's get all nickel &amp; dime on the books that create the IP.

FF Week #30--Lo, There Shall Be An Ending! My heartfelt farewell to Fantastic Four Week http://t.co/VHOx7y1sa9
FF Week #29--A Few Words About The New Fantastic Four Movie (Spoiler Free)!! http://t.co/mTwkfQl8dZ
Serious true fact: in the eyes of the #FFmovie, the bad guys are NASA and teachers. Really.
One of the candidates should have turned to the Fox panel &amp; said "Your company puts out crap like Fantastic Four &amp; you dare question us?"
Perhaps the worst crime of the #FFmovie: there was an obvious set-up for introducing Red Ghost and the Super-Apes. OBVIOUS. And they didn't.
"There is no Victor--only Doom!" Yes, that's an actual line of dialogue. No, it's not used ironically. #WhoYouGonnaCall
Friday Night Fights--Fantastic Four Week Style!! http://t.co/NyZAnl3ARz
Ff Week #27--Covering Byrne! http://t.co/a3Yg0BCj9O
@robfatheatre Fantastic Four, fool
And don't get me started on Doom. Good gravy, it may not be possible to mishandle a character any worse...
It's very much a nu52/DC movie version of the FF. Which is probably not what the FF should be.
Not as bad as many are saying, but it's still several miles from good. Tepid, dark, no theme or message or purpose. No pulse.
7 minutes to crushing disappointment. #FF

@LandryQWalker We'll just have to agree to disagree here.
@LandryQWalker Blame that on your/Image's marketing. Image's site &amp; Comixology just say "alternate ending"
@LandryQWalker If it helps, when the Clue movie forced people to purchase multiple tickets to see alternate endings, I hated that, too.
@LandryQWalker Sorry, Comixology said 5.
@LandryQWalker Charging $3 for 5 pages? Sure. Certainly less wasteful than having to buy 2 nearly-identical comics.
@LandryQWalker That was before you brought up the "we're losing $." Can't be sympathetic to an issue I had no way of knowing.
@LandryQWalker Charge more. I would gladly pay more than $2.99 for a comic. I don't like having to pay twice for 80% of the same comic
@LandryQWalker A) pissed is certainly overstating things  B) I sympathize with your financial concerns, while you dismiss mine as whiny
@LandryQWalker OK, what comic should I not have purchased in order to read the alternate ending?
@LandryQWalker If I were petulant, I might suggest fans loyal enough to stick despite 2yr hiatus might deserve bonus like that for free....

@PluperfectNemo In Titanic, we didn't know who survived, even if we knew the history. In Gotham, we do know the fate of all the characters.
So will there be any point to show except watching things get worse, week by week? To watching killings and gang wars and Gordon failing?
So the whole point of the show is watching our hero character fail time after time after time, until Bruce grows up.
We know Gordon doesn't prevent the rise of the Riddler or Joker or Penguin. We know that he doesn't stop Selina from turning to crime.
The problem with Gotham is that its central premise is failure. We KNOW that Gordon doesn't succeed in cleaning up GCPD.
