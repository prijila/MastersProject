@kcase great news because all the emails I’ve sent got a reply this was the new way for the widget to work. Thank you.
@MacSparky @OmniFocus is there a way to make a perspective that replicates what’s only due today since universal build doesn’t by default.
@kcase @OmniFocus can’t replicate what’s only due today in a perspective. 2/2
@kcase @OmniFocus no tasks showing in universal build because defer time hasn’t arrived is horrible. 1/2 http://t.co/61eI6P4HWk
@ztjio I understand what you’re saying but why make the built in functionality worse. Is my question and complaint.
@ztjio no. I only have beta OmniFocus universal build. Current version. http://t.co/oidDhBWzP7
@ztjio items scheduled for today nothing in widget using show due today option. http://t.co/aP7usCXQuY
@ztjio step back function in my opinion. Nothing shows up in today widget till I open the app pretty useless. 2/2
@ztjio the app before the universal app showed everything due today not what had reached the defer to time in the widget. 1/2
@ztjio yes but the due today only shows items that their defer to date and time are active.
@OmniGroup instead of everything due today like before the universal build in testflight. So my today widget doesn't show any most times 2/2
@OmniGroup I have been discussing it with support. The new way is to show items in the widget when the defer to time starts. 1/2

OmniFocus 2 Mac Release Notes http://t.co/AGy1Iwbm6v via @instapaper
@PastorMichael @dueapp I agree. No way to know. It used to have a vibrate when silenced feature to still kinda notify you.
@PastorMichael @dueapp it allows me not to ignore what I need to get done. Just because it simply nags you till you complete it.
@PastorMichael @dueapp I do. Currently using things. I’ve also used OmniFocus and the hit list. Marking complete stops the sound for me.
@PastorMichael @dueapp if you slide right to left a little it marks the item complete. If you slide far it deletes it http://t.co/fomeLt7iQS
@PastorMichael @jcgarcia24 @dueapp I get banners and sound on my iPhone 6 plus. Maybe try deleting and reinstall.
@exchgr @culturedcode I’m sure Things 3 will have that if enough people request it.
@exchgr @culturedcode personally I like seeing everything in my today section in the widget.
@rohdesign it is beautiful. I hope Things 3 has notification times  and the ability to add pics, voice memos to the notes on iOS
@mothnode @culturedcode try looking in your purchased area in the App Store
@PastorMichael @jcgarcia24 @dueapp you get a banner and sound and it appears in Notification Center.
@culturedcode No Problem. 2.6 is great by the way.
@culturedcode direct download. Thanks for the reply.
@PastorMichael @jcgarcia24 @dueapp a reminder that doesn’t stop reminding you till you mark it done.
@macpowerusers next time you guys should look into Moneywiz 2. Awesome app.
@Nostradamion @thehitlist @todoist agreed I really want an iPad app too though.
@Nostradamion @thehitlist agreed. I want widget/extension, Mac app update, iPad app, background sync.
@Nostradamion @OmniFocus @kcase awesome to hear. If @thehitlist hits all my marks for a GTD app I’m with them.
@Nostradamion @OmniFocus is slow with even a manual sync. Sometimes 30 seconds plus to sync to one device.
@Nostradamion @todoist things is pretty darn fast I’ve watched it propagate across devices in minute or less.
@Nostradamion  @OmniFocus I’m using the 2.1 beta. It looks good. Sync still sucks though.
@Nostradamion @dueapp @goodtaskapp I’ve used due to remind me of things everyday. Stays in my dock.

@DeaNHtiD99 No Problem. personally I wish OmniFocus sync was better. I’m back on Things by @culturedcode
@DeaNHtiD99 @OmniFocus you have to setup calendar reminders in settings the set to remind 1 hour before.
@Nostradamion @dahanbn @thehitlist needs Mac app update, iPad app, exten./widget, handoff, background sync. It could be the best with these.
@suyashlunawat12 @culturedcode OmniFocus could be the best. It’s sync is horrid and no handoff support.
@culturedcode is handoff not working between Mac and iPhone on iOS 2.6 update.

@Pgruneich @karelia I purchased 2.0. I think I should be able to complain about no iPad app etc. Sync included is nice addition though.
@Pgruneich @karelia he works for Karelia now. Just saying.
