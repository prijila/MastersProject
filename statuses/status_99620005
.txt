@DavidOrlic30 @WWERollins Cash in the brief case for title shot at the next ppv and win the title ONE ON ONE.
@DavidOrlic30 @WWERollins MITB match should not exist.He should taken that brief case hit Roman with it cause him the match.Then went to Raw
@DavidOrlic30 @WWERollins Nope Rollins should won the title in a One on One match....Enough said
@DavidOrlic30 @WWERollins and the classic wrestling on the network.nothing current
@DavidOrlic30 @WWERollins Seth should have beat Orton not Lesner...I really should be talking adout this cause I don't watch WWE only mania
@DavidOrlic30 @WWERollins I have no problem with Seth winning all title matches should be a one on one match
@DavidOrlic30 @WWERollins I did not want Roman to win I wanted Daniel Bryan to win the title
WWE is getting the SmackDown laid down on them in the stock market
@DavidOrlic30 @WWERollins I did not like the ending Rollins should have won the belt one on one..
@DavidOrlic30 @WWERollins That sucked and it was WWE choice not Seth Rollins.
As long as you keep giving #WrestleMania away for free on the network I will continue to watch it and that is the only time I watch WWE.
@VinceMcMahon you no longer have what takes to be the CEO and #WrestleMania proved..Thatis the reason I don't watch WWE anymore.
The only reason I watched mania cause I knew @TheRock was going to be there.Next years #WrestleMania will have more Surprises
After thinking about it overnight,#Wrestlemania WWE has to feel the mania with surprises to make the show good.
@IVPvideos my complaint WWE has to pull surprises to make the show good.
Congrats to @WWERollins for becoming the new WWE Champion...Good ol Iowa boy accomplished his WWE Dream #WrestleMania
@OGTslay1974 WWE probably gave him that Entrance
Thatcher vs Tommy End was hard hitting wrestling action....awesome match #WWNLIVE
I told you seth rollins was going to win. Predictible #WrestleMania
WWE has to pull surprises like that to make #WrestleMania  good.Now its on to Evolve 40 #WrestleMania

If Roman wins the crowd will lose it...#WrestleMania
RT @RealPatMcNeill: I'm not sure, but I think the crowd is behind Brock Lesnar.  #WrestleMania
Lets go lesner,Lets go lesner,Lets go Lesner #WrestleMania
WWE is taking the nascar approach put him on the Today show,Instead of Today show offering the winner a spot on the today show #WrestleMania
I would not be surprised if Undertaker lost for a 2nd time in a row #WrestleMania
Undertaker still got it please....Undertaker him self knows he don't have it anymore #WrestleMania

RT @RealPatMcNeill: Triple H tells us he's given his blood, sweat, tears and passion for WWE.  And his semen.  #WrestleMania
Sting wrestling at #WrestleMania is historic not the match
There is nothing historic about this match #WrestleMania both guys are not in there prime this is really historic.
That was sting's Entrence lol...HHH is going have this big nice entrence #WrestleMania
The main event will be a long main event #WrestleMania
Good choice by WWE for keeping the title on Orton....#WrestleMania
I predicting Seth Rollins to win the title #WrestleMania....The only problem I am not feeling it him being a champion
Come on,there not even head buting each other #WrestleMania
#WrestleMania will turn into the most talked about event in history,What are the fans really saying about mania
The wooden ladder made no sense #WrestleMania
There is a lot of empty seats at #WrestleMania

@c2djycc1994 @Gladiator316 I don't watch amateur wrestling......I had friends that were amateur wrestlers
@Gladiator316 @c2djycc1994 WWE is focused on Promos and backstage segments..Pro Wrestling is focused on the wrestling moves.
