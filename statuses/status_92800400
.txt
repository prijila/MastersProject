@siedwardscamera Yeah I’ll check it out. You’ve intrigued me!
@siedwardscamera Hmm That does sound appealing! There were a lot of silly questions last BVE. Are there good talks and things?
@siedwardscamera Oh! haha not quite Vegas of Nevada. I haven’t heard of it then. Better than @BVExpo?
@siedwardscamera @BVExpo @BSC_EXPO Ooooh Is that the Vegas one?
@siedwardscamera they look good too! For £650 or so can't be bad. Are you going to @BVExpo?
@siedwardscamera yup they have their problems too but the image is amazing for the price on the 2.5k one, can only assume better of the 4k.
@siedwardscamera they were yeah but the BM 4K has a super35 sensor and only a couple hundred quid more.
Looking forward to seeing the Taylor Wessing #Photography #exhibition at @NPGLondon on Friday. The brochure looks stunning! Anyone been yet?
Hmm Panasonic still tagging along with everyone else: 4K for £2K. Still Micro 4/3 though so BM might still have it. http://t.co/T83cqUSpHo
By cheap I mean a shooter package under £100 a day no deposit.

@flarliechynn Oh they're nice lenses. Much better for light anyway. :)
@flarliechynn Meh all takes practice, fun is not knowing if it worked or not. it'll be dark indoors that's the only thing. f/4 is dark...
@BradleyStearn Hahaha same, it's just fun to say it in front of your editor :)
@BradleyStearn That's definitely a good approach no one likes the people who say fix it in post! Trying to get into adapting lenses myself
@flarliechynn What do the numbers on it say? Course it counts I bet it's lovely! You used it yet?
@BradleyStearn Thanks, it's way too shaky but it shows off the lens nicely. It's ungraded too, the lens adds a sepia tone to everything.
@BradleyStearn https://t.co/LMa5JNRlG0 little example of the flare on the 28 from a while ago. Got some stills which show it more somewhere
@BradleyStearn I've got a 28mm f/2.4 Canon FD lens with the most ridiculous flare you've ever seen!
