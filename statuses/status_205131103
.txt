@jackschofield Seeing a lot of @LUNAYourMoon on here today. I’ve ordered one though so it’s worked for them.
@SteelBookBluRay Now that’s a good film. I hope they have some awesome artwork on it. Either way I’ll be ordering. Thanks for the heads up
I’ve just ordered a medium sized @LUNAYourMoon What an amazing product and seriously cool. Shame I have to wait until March.

@SteelbookZombie Lets hope they don’t fuck up the stock and listing then otherwise I’ll want my money back for this zbox
@SteelbookZombie When do you think they’ll release the steelbook? I’ll be getting this zbox and stuffing it straight in a cupboard 😂

@Linzking Did I? I don’t remember that. I winning for now so I’m happy 😄
@Linzking Its not funny 😢
@Linzking So I see…. And winning 😤
@Linzking What’s your name on it?
@Linzking Yep all good thanks. I might have to download it then and give you a game. I haven’t played it in a couple of years
@Linzking Unfortunately they are about. Hope alls well with you? Do you still
Play WWF?
@Linzking Someone beat you at words with friends? 😜 I might have to download that again and challenge you lol
@SteelbookZombie Thanks, mate appreciate that. Can’t believe there’s no steelbook release in the UK for this film. Shocking.
@SteelbookZombie OK. Nice one, mate. I'll keep checking
@SteelbookZombie Just logged in using UK login and got a load red text in Italian when trying to checkout.
@SteelbookZombie Do they ship to the UK?
@SteelbookZombie Sweet! Nice one fella
@SteelbookZombie Is that Kingsman steelbook Region A? All I can find is region A, no B’s or region free.

@SkyHelpTeam I’m guessing your next suggestion to me will be a planner rebuild? Seem to have to do one of those per week.
@SkyHelpTeam Well they don’t as you can see. Two in there now and one should be scheduled as its for next Monday. http://t.co/yIpcFNM6L7
@SkyHelpTeam What about the series links that appear in all/downloaded &amp; recorded page? This is a poor update I have to say.
@SkyHelpTeam Switched off at mains and duplicate series links still there
@SkyHelpTeam I’ve also got duplicates in scheduled such as Blacklist and Gotham. Actual links/records &amp; also searching next series.
@SkyHelpTeam Boardwalk Empire was one show that came back in to scheduled. There were a couple more but I deleted this morning.
@SkyHelpTeam Also in the new scheduled page on planner there are now series links for series that are no longer in production. Why?
@SkyHelpTeam Since software update last night for planner I now have series links in all &amp; scheduled so can’t keep track. It’s a mess
@RCSheffield I ordered Happy Monday’s &amp; Ocean Colour Scene from your eBay at 12:05 last night. Awesome stuff!

@fatlad33 @PrettyGreenSub I was in the PG Glasgow store a couple of weeks ago &amp; made a few purchases. A fine, large store also.
@MrsRobbieD It looks like you’re dressed to rob the place haha
@Linzking Hey Linz. Been a while. Hope you’re well?
@LondonSockCo I can’t wait. I rather enjoyed organising my queue for the next 12 months. You have some great colours.
Just joined @LondonSockCo club and looking forward to my monthly delivery.
@ChristPA Thanks.
@ChristPA Where did you get that TV unit from? Looks great.
@sainsburys Thanks CJ
@Rosie6978 I think I’d sooner look at that picture than watch the game
@PrettyGreenSub Took delivery of number 2 this week. Awesome coat and the velvet collar is a class touch.

@SkyHelpTeam The Newsroom season 2 was aired long ago. I was wondering why it’s not available on demand like season 1 ahead of season 3.
@SkyHelpTeam Still no season 2 of The Newsroom on demand. Will this be appearing?
@BBCiPlayer Shame it’s not in HD
Finished this morning. Now to find my next @LEGO_Group project. http://t.co/6fuUlUPUlt
@tashaontv @CameronYardeJnr  Connect your iPhone to your computer &amp; update.
@BarclaysOnline Thank you!
@BarclaysOnline Is it correct that I need to update the Barclays apps before updating to iOS8? No app updates but iOS8 now available

@MensFashiongeek I always where possible match socks to tie. It’s worked well for me so far.
@SkyHelpTeam Why is only season 1 of The Newsroom on anytime+? Any plans to add season 2?

@sainsburys When I search for Charlie Bigham’s on your site I find them. As soon as I log in to order, search/items not available
@sainsburys Thanks,Lynne. But when I log in to do my shopping it says unavailable. Has done for the last 3 weeks.
@sainsburys Why aren’t Charlie Bigham’s meals available to order on-line yet they are stocked in my local store?
@IainKirtley @teddy_ward @Ricki_Malone Recently did the back to the future car. Still need to get the Millennium Falcon though.

@mediamuseum We thoroughly enjoyed our day today. Great museum! We loved it. Thank you.

@mediamuseum Coming to see you tomorrow with my 2 nephews. Everyone is looking forward to it!

@ChloeHaywood That was obviously a joke. I’m a great buddy and good at what I do….. I tell myself that regularly
@ChloeHaywood Well maybe I could end up being your buddy and convincing you to be a SAM 😂
@ChloeHaywood Human football!!! Fuck that then. I’ve got a bad back.
@ChloeHaywood In that case you’ve been misquoted. Was that in your presentation?
@ChloeHaywood I think that’s table football and requires minimal physical exertion so I might give it a go.
@reigny Hello beautiful. Long time no tweet. Hope you’re well?
@ChloeHaywood We also need to talk as someone told me you have aspirations of being a WFA.
@ChloeHaywood Get a lift 2 the summer event &amp; get twatted on warm, flat cider. I might even consider chauffeuring you if you’re entertaining
@ChloeHaywood Well that’s disappointing!!
@ChloeHaywood Nice watch BTW
@ChloeHaywood Well I’m glad I did notice…. You’ve tweeted about it enough 😜 How drunk are you right now?
@ChloeHaywood You were inconsiderate having a birthday at the weekend and I didn’t look at Big Match yesterday so it’s kinda 50/50
@ChloeHaywood WOW!! Requested a full delete. You’re fucking hardcore, Haywood!
@ChloeHaywood I don’t check Big Match at the weekends.
@ChloeHaywood You RT’ed a birthday tweet…. That’s a bit attention seeking. But I’m glad you did otherwise I would never have known.
@ChloeHaywood You’ve not deleted FB. All you have to do is log back in again. Your friends have missed you! They really have 😋
@Sianwelby That looks like one of those posh Premier Inns. They are few and far between. Lenny Henry is full of shit!
@JoannaUK Seems ironic that someone who works for Twitter was shat on by a bird.
@naomi_kent Nice freckles on those legs, Naomi.
@JoannaUK I’m now imagining your hair is like the scene from Something About Mary…. But with bird poop
@JoannaUK You can’t tweet that and not provide a picture. Come on now.
@ChloeHaywood So it’s Happy Birthday then? Have a great day! Try not to get too drunk 😉

@JoanneMaira Not negative just an observation. Programme seems to be more about unknown #Wahlburgers than Mark &amp; Donnie.
So the #Wahlburgers have a new restaurant and a TV show at the same time. What a coincidence. They’re so lucky!
@hollyhowitt Either way… the more the scales go up, the better holiday you have. Enjoy!!
Is The #Wahlburgers on @LifetimeTelly just a programme to make famous the brother we never knew Mark &amp; Donnie had?
@hollyhowitt Maybe it’s so they can track how successful the all inclusive buffets are.
