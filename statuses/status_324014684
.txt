@mackemroyster but do we have the right owner/chairman? Short has piled the funds in already. Might be reluctant since he‚Äôs had no returns
@mackemroyster then who takes over? Fuck knows who‚Äôd even want the job.. Can‚Äôt think of anyone who‚Äôd want to take the job myself.
@KyleRob97 both teams should be doing better given the squads we have, but there‚Äôs too many prima donnas who are just after a paycheck
@mackemroyster exactly, especially since he‚Äôs a former spurs player. If he goes then we‚Äôre knackered.
‚ÄúBye small person‚Äù
@mackemroyster that‚Äôs if he stays‚Ä¶ if he‚Äôs offered a premier league job I wouldn‚Äôt be confident in us keeping him‚Ä¶.
@mackemroyster probably not many because they will still get a game in the premier league for the teams who want their ‚Äòexperience
@mackemroyster but how long will it take, can‚Äôt see us doing what Newcastle did and walking away with the league‚Ä¶
They end up doing fuck all for six months then leaving because they are finding it hard to adapt, even tho they‚Äôve only played 15mins
Sunderland need to completely overhaul their transfer strategy, stop buying people who need six months to ‚Äòadapt‚Äô to premier league demands
Both clubs are in disarray, only difference is Newcastle managed to get a few wins earlier in the season, while we were doing fuck all‚Ä¶
This is a bad time for north east football, neither Sunderland not Newcastle fans can honestly say they‚Äôre proud of their club.
@Dean97SAFC and yet if he was named safc boss there would be nothing but contempt for him.
@mackemroyster true, god knows what it‚Äôs gonna take for us to learn‚Ä¶
@mackemroyster our club is fucked up from the very top. Relegation may do us well, maybe next time we‚Äôre up we‚Äôll not fuck up quite as bad..

Brilliantly worked goal from arsenal
Is it just me or is jack wilshere not worth the risk anymore? He never seems to be able to play a full 90 mins without getting injured
@IDontPartyNow think he'll be gone come summer, get someone else in. Are we ever gonna play that scocco bloke?
@IDontPartyNow that was shocking from him, if he swung his foot at it he could've got a lucky deflection and taken it into extra time
@DMooreSAFC92 yup, wish it'd fell to borini or Gardner, someone who's not scared to put his boot thru it
@DMooreSAFC92 definitely, all he had to do was take a swipe at it and he could've got a lucky deflection to take it to extra time.
@DMooreSAFC92 should've buried that chance
Absolutely gutted
If fletcher had at least TRIED to shoot we might've got lucky and got a lucky deflection to take it to extra time!
Get rid of fletcher in the summer, fucking useless cunt. You need a goal and have a clear shot on goal so what do you do? FUCKING SHOOT!!
No way have we deserved to lose 3-1

@lufczico90 to be honest yea, sometimes he seems lazy and content to do as little as possible, I'd get a brand new strike force in
@DMooreSAFC92 exactly, hopefully we will learn our lesson this time round and get someone in over summer who will do the job
@lufczico90 I'd rather get rid completely to be honest, has never showed the talent in a red and white shirt we were hoping to see from him
@DMooreSAFC92 we need to get what we can for him and buy someone with a proven record in prem, Dutch league is no contest to prem for goals
@lufczico90 problem is with him, we've given him a game against lower league opposition where he should shine and he's appeared lazy
@DMooreSAFC92 definitely not, if you're a striker you have to at least try and score, I can't even remember him having any shots on goal
@lufczico90 was never over the moon with signing him in the first place, but from what I seen he's done Nowt to merit keeping him
@DMooreSAFC92 probably in his first game for his next club when we finally get shot of him

A draw is probably the best result for us, Newcastle don‚Äôt get too far ahead of us and Wigan don‚Äôt catch us up either.
@CraigMcfc95 no problem, hope you find what you need

RT @DanJL76: I've disliked Sunderland since the end of last season and the joy they showed that we'd lost the league.
Got out of jail in the first half, need to kick on in the second half and get the win!
@tasha_safc handled outside the area
@_chloemcfc so far Sunderland are lucky to be at 1-1 cos we don‚Äôt really deserve anything
@_chloemcfc well tbh after seeing a few replays I didn‚Äôt really think it did but the commentators seem to think it hit hit his elbows

Every player/team always ends a bad run against safc
Who else could we get in tho?
And why did we have 5 defenders on the bench and not a single attacking minded player? How weak is our squad? It‚Äôs only going to get worse!
Why can‚Äôt we ever push on when we get a few decent results?? We always get sucked back into the relegation battle! Fucking useless!
