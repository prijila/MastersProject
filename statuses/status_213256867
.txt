@cllrstephenwest thanks for following
My logs have many secrets... secrets about sylvan sprites &amp; impossible islands. Unfortunately I don't speak log-language. #sworcery
I love seeing the same woods in different weather &amp; I love to just stop and listen... to think or to not think as the case may be. #sworcery
Of course I never tell people about these goddess/tree dreams because they'll probably just call me a hippie or something. #sworcery
In my special place I visit with a titanic hollow tree... she is a goddess long-since dead who predates mankind by untold eons. #sworcery
In my dream-walking there is a special place I will always go, a parliament of trees at the heart of the world. #sworcery
When you're lucid in a dream you'll realize who you've imagined you are... but to identify with the dream is to become bewitched. #sworcery
He spoke of an old story that his people typically told their children to freak them out. #sworcery
She told us about how the dreams of her people held many mysteries &amp; how they reflected the moods of the moon in strange ways. #sworcery
We asked about The Trigon Trifecta &amp; the locations of the remaining two Trigons but his response was irritatingly obtuse. #sworcery
We told the ghost dude of our intention to detonate The Megatome atop Mingi Taw &amp; release The Gogolithic Mass from immortality. #sworcery
In The Trigon Grove beyond the cavernous cave in the meadow we approached a solitary grave &amp; were met by a glowing ghost dude. #sworcery
... Was this The Trigon Grove? #trigongrove #sworcery
Beyond the cavernous cave in the meadow we came upon a secluded grove with a collection of strange stone structures. #sworcery
Another worthless sheep - why do we keeping looking at it? #worthlesssheep #sworcery
We just woke a slumbering sylvan sprite between two loathsome rainbows by the side of The Perilous Precipice. #sworcery
We spied a collection of graves in a thicket to the side of the old road &amp; we wondered what was up with that. #sworcery
We told Logfella why we wandered here in this mountain wilderness &amp; how we were guided by the finger of an all-knowing God. #sworcery
To stop the song of sworcery at any time, simply tip tap upon the sworcery aura that surrounds The Scythian. #sworcery
Once you have begun to sing a song of sworcery, ever-so-gently touch &amp; swipe on the sworcery aura to look around. #sworcery
To sing a song of sworcery at any time, touch &amp; hold upon The Scythian for a moment or two &amp; observe the gathering sworcery aura. #sworcery
We just woke a slumbering sylvan sprite from the rich earth of a meadow containing four pairs of worthless sheep. #sworcery
We spied a few worthless sheep lazing around in the meadow. #worthlesssheep #sworcery
Confused? Excellent. Keep calm &amp; carry on. #sworcery
Silencing the storm will require some familiarity with psionics, cryptozoology &amp; miracles... #sworcery
It is a time of woe - a sinister thunderstorm has clouded the skies &amp; the lovely people who live in the hut are miserable. #sworcery
You woke the deathless spectre who still lurks in the darkness beneath Mingi Taw. What a creep, amirite? #sworcery
Ok, so where were we? Oh right, now I remember. You got a burdensome book known as The Megatome. #sworcery
It's lovely to see you again. Are you ready to begin session II of S:S&amp;S EP? #sworcery
Our research shows that prolonged exposure to the mythopoetic psychocosmology of S:S&amp;S EP can have adverse side effects. #sworcery
So you've awoken the deathless spectre who slumbered in the darkness beneath Mingi Taw - yikes! #sworcery
We got The Megatome &amp; we are the smartest. #gotmegatome #sworcery
We sensed a gathering thunderstorm &amp; yet a little song began in our heart. #sworcery
We had retrieved The Megatome &amp; Logfella was 100% ready to move it move it to the safety of his lodgings. #sworcery
We found The Megatome clasped in two bone hands &amp; we felt our sword stir in its sheathe. #megatome #sworcery
We spied an antlered skull floating in the darkness beneath Mingi Taw. #sworcery
We spied a pictographic representation of The Trigon Trifecta in the darkness beneath Mingi Taw. #sworcery
In a subterrenean corridor we spied an ominous statue but we didn't worry too much about it. #lore #sworcery
Above the rock-cut entrance to a mountain temple we spied a pictographic representation of The Trigon Trifecta. #sworcery
The woodsman known as Logfella was just going to wait here for us to return with The Megatome. #sworcery
The Megatome lurked somewhere in the haunted darkness beyond The Perilous Precipice beneath Mingi Taw. #sworcery
We told Logfella that we sought a burdensome book of sinister sworcery known as The Megatome. #sworcery
We spied the solitary grave at the edge of The Perilous Precipice &amp; we wondered what was up with that. #sworcery
You'll find this first S:S&amp;S EP session to be fairly straightforward. It typically only requires 15 - 30 minutes to complete.  #sworcery

@AlexSimpson138 .... Mainly because you are forced to write such short paragraphs its too difficult to get your point across succinctly.
