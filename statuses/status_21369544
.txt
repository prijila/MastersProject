I've actually liked quite a few of these songs &amp; it's interesting because I've never heard ANY of them. Wow, this guys is from Arkansas!
Stevie Nicks? Really? I wish she would sing Landslide. I guess the genres are breaking down. I like that. :)
I'm NOT a country music fan &amp; really can't explain why I'm watching the ACM but I actually like this duet by Blake Shelton &amp; Shakira.
Started a new hormone medication last night. Now ... feeling sick &amp; tired, as expected. Yuck! #SideEffects #PCOS #Endometriosis
To top it off, it has a 3 year warranty which is nice since I use a heating pad all day, every day &amp; wear them out fast. What a relief!
Thank God! I just found a reasonably priced on on Wal-Mart's website and it's FSA eligible! :) http://t.co/Fn3jbEDziK

This is NOT a good choice. In a day or two I will most likely be a physical, emotional, and psychological mess but what's new...? #FMTT  :(
It appears as though my body will make me choose between antidepressants &amp; pain meds. In other words, pain or panic attacks &amp; depression. :(
My BP is back down to 50/46! WTF? I'm slowly eliminating more meds for this reason but I'm not sure they are the problem. #ChronicPainSucks

@CherCeeEndoSis Thanks. It's frustrating because our insurance already paid them $800 of the $1,000 procedure. Such lack of compassion. :(

@BlondeBlogger I don't have a pulse-ox monitor but that is a very good idea. I should get one to watch for respiratory depression. :)
@BlondeBlogger It helps some but nothing seems to give me total relief. I can't tolerate the low BP though so I don't think I can stay on it
I've been sleeping most of the weekend. I wake up for a few hours, maybe watch a movie, and go back to bed. My idea of a perfect weekend. :)
@BlondeBlogger Thanks! This is my pain med, Fentanyl patch. It is the lowest dosage, 12 mcg/hr, but I had a feeling it would be too strong.
@nicrendesigns @blueoctober Yay! This is awesome. I'm sending my request now. #bluefamily  :)
