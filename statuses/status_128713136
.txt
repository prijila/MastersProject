Hopefully McClaren will silence the critics, especially those in red!
@Pete_Henderson It's all about the money though isn't it? Teams with money who spend well win games.
@Pete_Henderson maybe. But the results weren't always good? We play good football now but not getting the results. Let's see what happens.
@Pete_Henderson but you guys only play well under Billy. Maybe that says more about the club. We need to spend though! Just like Billy does
@Pete_Henderson I don think that'd be a bad appointment. If we can spend! Links with QPR is a positive.
All about the wedding albums today.
@Pete_Henderson exactly. You hold the record for crashing out of the playoffs. No competition there!
@MPBroadhurst come on now! The directors don't care what you think! Isn't that obvious!
@Pete_Henderson don't worry we won't be coming after Billy! ;)
@Pete_Henderson to be honest the result isn't an issue. It's the way the club is being managed. Spent nothing and expect miracles.
Sack a manager that has invested in talent at grass roots. A bright future gone! Joke!!

That would be quality. Thanks @Pete_Henderson Ive only just been playing with it tonight and need to have a proper read up over the weekend,
@Pete_Henderson It happened about 5 times. I then switched to wp-super cache which fixed that problem but introduced the homepage issue.
@Pete_Henderson Exactly, pretty poor for a blog. I think the other issue is when you switch orientation on iDevices, causes a browser crash.
@Pete_Henderson wp-super cache. I also tried W3 Total Cache. Just not too sure how to get the right settings.
Trying to sort out a cache for http://t.co/D2WL0aFN Does anybody, especially photographers have any tips for making WP sites quicker?
@mikepj82 to be honest I think I'll be buying tickets next week.
@mikepj82 Sofia still styling your hair?
@mikepj82 sad?? If you say so. You still having those reoccurring dreams about that giant thumb coming down to crush you?
@mikepj82 I actually think that could be true.

@MPBroadhurst That's alright then. Save them up and have 7 on the weekend!
@MPBroadhurst I snack a lot so basically just going to cut that out completely. I don't drink too much alcohol either so that helps.

@CocoMcPhee has ordered me to step away from the desk and go and get ready for tonight's party.
Been going through my shots from today. Had to stop myself from squealing like a little girl when I looked at the bride & groom portraits

I'm in a very happy mood today, things are starting to fit together nicely
Tony Rich Project's 'Nobody Knows It But Me' is a great song!
@ninablak Amazing!
I would seriously recommend having a look through this portfolio, I would say browse but you'll stay for a while! http://tinyurl.com/383smv6
@Loulouscafe you should start a morning session called the Yummy Mummies club
Looking forward to getting at least 5 hours sleep tonight. Hopefully beard will grow a little whilst I sleep too!
4 hours sleep! Got plenty to do today to keep me entertained so lots of strong, sugary black coffee for me. Royksopp as soundtrack I think.
So that he understands the importance of Christianity at Xmas I'll also be dressing up as baby Jesus. Just need to find a manger to fit in
Just need some mince pies to provide adequate filling for my Santa belly.
I'm trying to grow a beard for Xmas as it's my Son's first year where he'll be aware of the festivities.
Just got a bottle of whiskey from Carol and Chris, a happy bride and groom. It's going to make these cold nights much more pleasant.
Just got back from showing Chris and Carol their wedding images. Was good to see them again, such a fun, loving couple.
Now for some editing, just need to pick a late night soundtrack, hmmm

@Midwaymediauk It's obviously in er blood though! I'm going to get my little boy to start taking some pictures, or working on photoshop :)
I've just realised that coming on twitter when you're recording The Apprentice is a bad idea.
@Midwaymediauk I'm thankful that the cold weather is keeping the couples indoors, planning their weddings. How's yr daughters course going?
@Midwaymediauk We're good thanks. Just getting nice and cosy to welcome in the cold weather. Business is good, taken two bookings today :)
Good evening @Midwaymediauk  hope all is well. Thanks for the  #WW :)
Time for bed though now, the usual early start awaits.

I'm due to win the Euro Millions jackpot tonight! Let me know if you would like any!
@MartinB1884 Yeah a few people are saying that. But the demo for pro this year has been quality. Made some major changes to the game play.
@MartinB1884 No no no! Pro evo all the way.
Super excited that proevo is out this 2Mo. Wonder if I can class it as a business expense, great ice breaker with grooms, prob annoy brides!
@stush1979 yes but going to be in a bit.
@stush1979 are u watching it?
The Bodyguard. The film that blokes claim is a 'chick flick' but secretly like to watch it.
"It was shameful" whilst doing the Lord Sugar point... Genius!
@mattfoden He's clueless! How many times did you see that worried look on his face, had no control of the situation!
@ninablak lol. So annoying
@MartinB1884 let us know when u next do a gig, will come down.
@MartinB1884 you should definitely do creative writing
@MartinB1884 good stuff. I'm sure you'll do well, like my mum would say, 'you've got the gift of the gab'... With all due respects :)
@MartinB1884 No Thursday evenings are impossible for me. Hazards of work and childcare! How are you exams going?
@MartinB1884 Just a little, ha ha. Well first I should probably stop flexing my muscles and step away from the mirror. How about u?
Think its a shame that I always look more toned in the morning, but by the evening gravity has took effect. I might stay lay down all day.

My CD folio from SWPM have arrived promptly as usual. Now I can go about my day and prep for tomorrow's wedding at The Ringwood Hall Hotel
@MartinB1884 Great thanks, most rewarding job I've had. Just need you chaps to get producing now so Asher has some play mates ;)
Such a busy day 2day! In a nutshell ive got 2 do loads of creative things, admin things, personal things whilst looking after my 12month son
@MartinB1884 Good thanks mate. Staying nice and busy which means several hours in the office. What exams have u got?
@MartinB1884 How are you this morning Mr B?
A day 4 designing albums, cleaning equipment & hopefully updating websites. So glad the sun isn't out as reduces the chance of distraction!
@Midwaymediauk Was good thanks. Would like to go back soon for two reasons; The photographic opportunities and the whiskey :)
@Midwaymediauk  Thanks for the  #ff Hope you're enjoying your Thai :)
It's good to be back home. Have enjoyed a short stay in Scotland but always look forward to coming back to family and work.
'Love is a Battlefield', what an amazing song to drive to. Bobbing my head so much it nearly fell off my shoulders
Visited Glen Ord Distillery. Had a great chat with two workers over a couple of drams of whiskey. Can count three more hairs on my chest.

I'm so tired. Did a 2 hour run for Unicef this morning. I'm a bit like Gimli... wasted on long distances.! Started getting cramps at 1hr 45

Was thinking holiday started tonight but just been asked to meet a couple tomorrow for August 2011 wedding. Don't mind starting hols late.

@leighann_photo I know what you mean. I've toned up a little carrying mine about, haha
@leighann_photo ... for further flexibility switching between landscape and portrait
@leighann_photo I stick with Manfrotto because i can use the quick release with my tripod. Then I tend to have a ball mount...
@leighann_photo Most camera bodies and lenses have built in stabilisers so you can normally get away with it.
@leighann_photo Sorry to eaves drop! I prefer monopod's more flexibility

Thanks @Midwaymediauk  Just wanted to offer them something that fitted in with their theme.
Here's one of their postcards, what do you think http://yfrog.com/5fsbqij
My office is so chilly, and my hands so cold that I'm having difficulty holding my graphic tablet pen
... an alternative to a guest book or a mounted print.

Off to see Carol & Chris later to show them their postcards. They're having a holiday themed wedding at the Ringwood Hall Hotel...

Oh and yes the Reverend did say the wrong name! Stacey instead of Tracy. Good job it was tears of laughter.
Started processing images for yesterday's Wedding. Was a great day and so thankful that Tracy and Paul asked me to be a part of it.
Coming home after a long long long day. Absolutely love it though. Let's get a beer!

Just uploaded some recent work to Wedding and Lifestyle galleries at http://www.photography-shauntaylor.co.uk

Why is my neck so stiff! I'm turning my head like Arnie in Terminator. All I need now is your pants, jacket and motorcycle!
How relieving it was to work out how to turn off the BEEP on the Strobeam! Just need the stand now!
