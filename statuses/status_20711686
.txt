#debates - Obama is spouting the same crap he did four years ago. Time to change the diaper!
Mitt is not running against George W. Bush is he? Where do they get these morons?
Obama is demonstrating his commitment to education. He is displaying his B.S. degree!
Let them strap on gloves and rumble! I think Mitt would like to pop Barry in the mouth!
When a man is called a liar, he should be allowed to respond Ms. CNN!
But HOW Mitt!? How will you implement your five point plan sir?
Romney needs to be much more specific. His first answer was vague.

@toddstarnes @CalebParke @billwolf21 @dglasscock @bthockey  - Count me in!
Here is tonight's riddle. What do Joe Biden and the back-end of a horse have in common?
RT @SteveDeaceShow: We are now literally seeing the debate moderator tag team with Joe Biden. There's media bias -- and then there's this.
RT @toddstarnes: SHUT THE HELL UP, PLEASE.
Obama's gal pal is truly a wonderful, unbiased moderator.
I guess Biden had to strap on a pair since Michelle has Barack's in her purse!
Biden is flashing what my Dad use to call a, "Poop eating grin!" That is the sanitized version.
Zing! Biden just got his hide nailed to the wall!
RT @toddstarnes: Could someone get Joe a shot of Metamucil?
RT @JoelCRosenberg: Ryan is right: Obama went on a talk show rather than meet with Netanyahu.
@toddstarnes  - No he is auditioning for a Broadway role as the Cheshire Cat in Alice in Wonderland.
@theblaze @JoeBiden Trust us! We have your best interest in mind. We really do!
@toddstarnes - Yes, but she is totally unbiased! Perfect choice of moderator!
Bunch of malarky? The Obama/Biden ticket are highly developed in that!
@BretBaier - First blood drawn goes to Ryan!
Lincoln - See the trailer http://t.co/VNqKDyl5 - Wow, this looks good too!
