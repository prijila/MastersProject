@lizcastro :-) let's see!
@lizcastro Is it current because of discrimination or bureaucracy ?
@lizcastro I knew about it to an extent but certainly not about the names of places etc. That's way worse than I knew.
@lizcastro Had no idea. Knew language was basically banned but didnt realise names too. Appreciate how i may have seemed VERY offensive
@lizcastro so did all catalan names by default take on spanish equivalent? hence Artur = arturo?
@lizcastro @murri1972 would be grateful to understand more the importance of naming if you are able to?
@lizcastro I can understand more the reaction. There's lots of history and frustrations which i appreciate, but never mean to offend
@lizcastro had not idea it was offensive. Was genuine misspelling. In retrospect and having discussed things with people like @murri1972...
@lizcastro e.g. @murri1972 who i talk with regularly and we discuss things in friendly way and I learn. Not judging just saying..
@lizcastro no offensive was intended of course. I also fully appreciate it goes both ways and have made good 'twitter' friends with some
@lizcastro not saying it may or may not be justified that's a different Q but either way an uncomfortable weird feeling to be on end of

@laliferrer interesting indeed. Gotta go bed now. Will check foreign media tomorrow.
@jsolec I'm half english we're terrible at languages! I'm trying
@jsolec started Catalan learning online. still beginner. Will try!
@murri1972 @CalDirHo well indeed
@lexrodba @yaroslav personally blame Rajoy and PP. awful
@lexrodba @yaroslav it's all weird tho cos CUP won't pact with Junts pel Si unless they get rid of Mas. Wish Madrid would give referendum
@jsolec to be honest I didn't think it was still supposed to be that bad. What press would you suggest as most impartial?

@ricard_sole with any luck Rajoy will be gone soon. I hope.
@jsolec @catsiqueespot thank you I will indeed. Thanks for engaging. I appreciate it
@ricard_sole perhaps so. I think either way this will give the region better negotiating power
@jsolec point taken. I am merely reporting what TV are saying. Seems they are part of problem tho. Apologies if offended.Unintended
@CalDirHo ok I get you! Yes it turns out la sexta is not a channel I should be following their reports are saying def No majority votes
@jsolec @catsiqueespot perhaps I better pay less attention to the TV stations then eg la sexta. Maybe the media part of problem then
@ricard_sole it's certainly success but I think in referendum terms I do not think it is so clear. I do sympathise a lot though
@ricard_sole lol it's ok. I'm here to learn. I take all with pinch of salt as they say :-)
@ricard_sole they had a debate with all candidates last week? Is this rare?
@ricard_sole lol fair point :-)
@ricard_sole why then are la sexta reporting it so? Apologies if I'm being mistaken
@quimsb fair point. Ultimately what's needed is a proper referendum. I believe people should have right to real choice
@ftorrell @lizcastro FYI. Personally I agree with a full legal referendum. Think people deserve a vote on this matter
@quimsb @jamesrbuk are la Sexta not reporting properly then?
@ftorrell @lizcastro booing the PM (rightly or wrongly) so that he can't walk down street, police blocking protestors I'd not say is calm
@ftorrell @lizcastro id say pushing people out voting stations and surrounding voters shouting with nationalist flags is tense
@jsolec you win seats by not majority of pro yes votes. And I personally think there should be a full proper referendum
@hypatia2009 most have not voted for independence. I'll respect Mas when his party pay back the 3% in kicks backs
@ftorrell @lizcastro @jamesrbuk I have no reason to Make it up. And by the way personally I favour a referendum
@ftorrell @lizcastro @jamesrbuk a lot of Spanish people I know are worried as are a number of Catalan entrepreneurs I work with
@murri1972 perhaps they might change. Who knows. I think either way Catalunia is now in a stronger negotiating position perhaps
@lizcastro @jamesrbuk different opinions. Can only tell you what I've heard from people I know. Non Catalans I know here very worried
@murri1972 well let's hope not!
This is amusing. Junts pel Si can only rule via coalition with hard left CUP who will only pact of the Arturo Mas goes #27STV3
@murri1972 you don't? Sorry what do you mean?
So Arturo Mas and his party have got less votes than last time round #27S2015
Great campaign by @InesArrimadas for @CiudadanosCs She's going places fast #27S
@murri1972 with any luck he'll be gone by end of the year along with PP. I hope @CiudadanosCs don't pact with them that's the worry
@muscledit well indeed. Risky. Rajoy will be gone by end of year. There'll them be renewed calls for a referendum. And on and on and on...
Head of Cataln socialist party congratulates Juntes pel si but says he 'hopes they respect the law' - ie don't declare independence #27S
Great work by @CiudadanosCs winning 25 seats. They'll have major role in general election #s27 #cataloniaindependencia
At least it's clear Arturo Mas will finally go. Thank everyone for that #s27 #cataloniaindependencia
@muscledit hahaha
@mlka7 well indeed
@muscledit well let's see. They hate Mas. He certainly couldn't lead
@murri1972 well we all know Rajoy is an idiota :-)
@muscledit @jamesrbuk that's Spanish politics for you. Openly corrupt leaders still voted in
@skender I agree with that
@murri1972 ha! I meant 'Madrid'
@muscledit @jamesrbuk he's totally incompetent. Other members of the coalition wouldn't let him lead it
@murri1972 know if what's true? The final result?
@Sam_Cookney pro independent parties got less votes but more seats
@skender fair enough to but if you believe in true democracy you can't declare independence when most don't want it
I blame Rajoy largely for this mess. He should have granted referendum years ago #s27
@murri1972 masked should indeed have had a referendum. Don't think it's legitimate to declare independence when most don't want it
@jamesrbuk apparently Arturo Mas is gone. CUP will never let him lead. It's a total mess indeed!
@jamesrbuk is already. I'm here. It's real tense. People worried.
@jamesrbuk I know but Arturo Mas is saying that Catalunia has voted in favour. It hasn't. It's totally illegitimate on numerous levels
@murri1972 just over 52
@skender that's irrelevant. You can't call 47% a victory for democracy. It's simple maths. Most Catalans voted NO.
On what planet is 47% a majority #s27 http://t.co/hKh4f93jrp
Ridiculous. Yes vote claiming victory although only 47% votes Yes. Arturo Mas needs maths lessons #s27
if Rajoy had bothered to run a referendum with a proper campaign it would have been been a No vote 3 years ago #27S
@AlbertoNardelli lol ok!
@AlbertoNardelli good to know. You in barcelona?

@Ishitonallah Read your bio. You do realise your beloved England funded extremists right? just checking @SaxonInfidel
@SaxonInfidel Just cos it says that doesn't mean everyone follows word for word. I know many who dont
@Ishitonallah they don't hold it against me that UK has bombed the crap out of their homelands or that the West props up arab dictators
@Ishitonallah I've got many muslim friends who've never done wrong, why offend them? 1/2
@Ishitonallah @SaxonInfidel Some, some not but get your point. Not ALL muslims adhere to every word of the Quaran though
@SaxonInfidel vaguely but feel free to elaborate on my basic understanding. Always happy to lear
@Ishitonallah @SaxonInfidel The old testament also does. Many religions do and SOME have always used it as excuse
@SaxonInfidel It does IMO. Some people don't trust muslims but will happily trust everyone else.

@flemingsean which not?

@markrlowe one says they can save £5bn on tax avoidance the other £7.5bn No idea
@markrlowe pretty sure they both make it up as they go along
@markrlowe main point Is that Conservatives seem as determined as Labour in refusing to come clean about debt. IMHO
@markrlowe bailout done through QE not debt and was mainly in 08 before Osborne-not had it easy but repeatedly borrowed more than aimed
@markrlowe agreed but it's a interesting fact nonetheless. And one that I was not aware of. Bailouts or not
