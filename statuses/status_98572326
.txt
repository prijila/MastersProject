Just jumped outta my damn chair and flew in the air because @Corey_Feldman is a rad man who gives back to his fans...tenfold!!'
Dear @Corey_Feldman, Coreyography is better than Kerouac, and "Ascension Millennium" is as catchy as "P.Y.T." Please gimme the lyrics!!!!!!!
My end of life montage: every time I peed in urinals full of ice. It's my Rushmore.
So @Corey_Feldman, help a brother out and out those lyrics online! Or DM me. #ascentionmillennium #MaximumCatchy
@Corey_Feldman My lady LOVES "Ascension Millennium." (and so do I). i wanna cover it for her on Valentine's, but can't find the lyrics...
I really hope this kid singing "Santaria" gets killed in a school shooting. Keith Ubran is a queef. #AmericanIdol
My verse would be: "Fuck, man, my #iPadAir can't get WiFi in this fucking cave! This meeting of the Dead Poets' Society is ADJOURNED!"
Never forgiving that candy-sweet, gay-positive sitcom for making fun of Kill Bill. I hate the Internet. I hate @BuzzFeed #HowIMetYourRacism
Hey, #HIMYM, none of the bald people get laid on your show. Wait, you have no bald people. And none of them have glasses either! Or asthma!
The trajectory of #howimetyourracism, from beginning to end, is a slide-show of all that is wrong with the internet.
So that's three death-by-cell phone stories. Wait. Four! Hey kids, watch out for those selfies. #SelfiesKill
RT @billyeichner: "I voted for the song from Frozen"-the ghost of Nelson Mandela
Withdrew all the money I've made from Spotify and Bandcamp to get a pack of smokes. $6.28 cents. Can't buy no smokes with that. I quit music
I wish I did cocaine, so I could finally enjoy Joe Walsh.
The rest of 2014 is just gonna be depressing as shit, cause @cellcamp used up all the funny in the world tonight. #RIPLacotta
@superchunk It's gonna be like Florida in Chicago when you're here (but without the Floridians).

Dear Sammy Cahn, lyricist of the song "Let it Snow." Go fuck yourself.
Here's what I can make out of my four pages of chicken-scratch: (arrow pointing to the words -&gt;) "get epic here"

I have but one 2014/39th birthday wish for the entire universe: to never hear that damn Macklemore and Lewis song again.

Yo Puerto Rico! I wanna see a fuckin' punk rock show while I'm here. Hell, I wanna play a punk show while I'm here. Let's do this.
"OH, THAT'S GOOD!" says Adriane, upon her first sip of @CashOnlyBeers porter. My sentiments exactly. They should be charging $20 a pint.
And although my cat is a senior, it doesn't excuse her casual racism.
So my cat is now considered a "senior" cat, which explains why she's been watching so much Catlock.
Now losing my @kickstarter virginity  because @halhartley trumps helping a friend's EP come out on colored vinyl http://t.co/Jk1hyP837X

When you think about it, Loverboy's "working for the weekend" is depressing as hell.
Shit. I forgot to say happy birthday to my favorite intellectual snob and tanker sundae aficionado  @brianjrogers
The best thing about having no followers on twitter? i can electronically emote things like: "I kinda hate Chicago &amp; need to leave."

@andreagrimes wanna get really creeped out? Ladies are lovin' that guy, and singin his abuse anthem with full lungs. Scary stuff.
Hey #PhilCollins, I'm having a ball, and I'm an illegal alien. You wouldn't know fun if it bit you in the ass.
But I accept your offer to call me Betty. Sorry, this psychedelic noise fest I'm at is really making me pine for Paul Simon right now
Cause cartoon graveyards are the shit, but do you know what's even better? Being a cartoon. Instead of Al, I'll call ya Mr. Fleshy Sourpuss
Hey Paul Simon, ending up a cartoon in a cartoon graveyard actually sounds like a pretty damn good way to go.
I just started my next Fucking Christmas record and it's just the most horrendous thing. You're lucky to know me.
The only miracle of this shit week: didn't have to hear Ministry's shitty "Everyday is Halloween."
Gotta admit, standing on my front porch, drinking, smoking, and telling kids, "I ain't got no candy. Just beer," is a lot of fun.
RT @David_Williams: Fleetwood Mac's "Rumors" only sold 45 million copies, but everyone who bought one started a wedding band.
Got it. "Crackpot Caucasian Catechumen" or "Bedlamite Anglo-Saxon Zealots." And our tags will look like Guernica compared to these idiots.
or maybe "The Four-Eyed Dukes?" I dunno. I just can't beat 'em, and sure can't join them since I hate killing bums and being jumped in.
I won't say the name of the gang that is now claiming our hood, but here's a hint. I'm staring my own gang: The Irish-German-Jewish Dukes
@underalls @DAVID_LYNCH I met him. Just as sweet as you'd expect, defying all those "don't meet your heroes" stigmas.
@LibertyMutual Bruce Hornsby &amp; The Range's "That's Just the Way It Is." Now THAT's how you sell insurance!
Hey @LibertyMutual It's a song about fuckin' around during a separation...and it's not subtle.
@LibertyMutual's use of Human League's "Human"in their ads—a song about boning other during a separation—makes me glad I don't own a car.
Hey, #TheKnack, I get you.
My #ventra card just arrived, and it felt like I got my draft card. Seriously, Buffalo Springfield starting play out of the mailbox.
@joemcadam I hear Rome gets really angry when the dead guy's mom smokes pot, hits the bottle, and goes right to the rock. Just furious.
@JessicaChasmar and Andy Griffith wasn't big on killing Jews. You're too cute to be another @AnnCoulter

Things I've fought today: the law, the man, the machine, the common cold, my alderman, the Office of Inspector General, and Comcast.
@RCNconnects Done! Now get closer!!!
@ward32chicago You're a good dude. My apologies for making you the patsy for the foibles of others. Glad you're fightin' for us.
@RCNconnects Comcast is detestable. Hey, RCN? Why won't you cover other Chicago neighborhoods? Bucktown needs you.
PS, @ward32chicago, the water in your ward now has extra lead
My point is, @ward32chicago, corrupt construction is wrecking your ward and making your constituents miserable. Will you do something?

Yup. ran through the lyrics of @TheReplacements "Waitress in the Sky," and anyone who decried it misogynist is stupid. It's a class takedown
If ya wanna find hell with me, i recommend the Holstein Park circus that's blasting "Gangham Style" at 180 dbs. I hate my alderman.

Yo, @randallcolburn, we meet for drinks after this shit.
As first on in line for Bob and David, I can report, with no arrogance, that I'm the hottest comedy nerd in town. #foxyRoy
@nathanrabin and you saw Rancid instead of Public Enemy? I'm revoking your old fart card.
@RiotFest 1. Umbrellas allowed for tomorrow? 2. It was impossible to get to the VIP area at the rock stage for Joan Jett. Can u clear a path
This smooth jazz cover of Simply Red's "holding back the years" is actually rougher than the original...As I await a tooth extraction
@RiotFest @SamsungMobile #MakeItMega "Sad and Fat (and Rocking Hard!)"
Wish ya'd balanced the great old fart bands a little better, sez the old farts who don't give 2 shits for Blink or Fall Out @RiotFest
But at least you put the Pixies right before The Replacements, so that people have to skip the Pixies to see the Mats @RiotFest
Do you remember when you scheduled Public Enemy and Rancid at the same time and made people sad?@RiotFest
I wrung a liter of sweat outta my shirt after that show. Gavage rocked like murder.
CHICAGO! I'm playing tonight at Township. 8:30. If you surprise me, I'll surprise you.
Hey @jonwurster, when you ditched your sunglasses during Learn to Surf, it had the gravitas of Belushi.
I hope everyone at the Hideout Block Party appreciates that @matthewbarnhart is running sound. That's why it sounds so damn good.

So again, my apologies to Woody Allen and Noah Baumbach, whose movies always go to Chicago's worst: Landmark Centre Cinema. @LTChicagoIL
As a former Landmark employee, who bent over backwards to make the moviegoing experience good for all, my disgust for @LTChicagoIL has merit
Creaky seats, torn screen, rudest audiences that never stop coughing or talking. I get sad when a movie I want to see goes to @LTChicagoIL
i hope that Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig know that I only missed Frances Ha because @LTChicagoIL is the worst theater in Chicago.

"Free and Young," "Graduation Gladulation," "Did It, But I'm Not Done," "Innocent Til Proven Sexy," "Drugs Make Everything Better."
Prepping "It's A Shame About Roy," my first album of positive lyricism. Relentlessly pandering. The kids will love it. Song titles so far...
Hey Neil. I noticed...but I was just embarrassed for you. LA's not so bad. Love, The Chair
The new album will be called "It's a Shame About Roy." Most of the lyrics will feature the phrase "it's alright."

I just got a boner watching the trailer for "The Wolf of Wall Street." One of those coke-boners. You wouldn't have even noticed it.
@Nightline when Ted Kopple anchored and tweets weren't news. But it's not top story, or in your language, "viral," material
@Nightline when Nightline blew the lid off internet gaffs
An honest, innocent, and romantic question: Is there a motel in Chicago with a nice bland continental breakfast and a firm vibrating bed?
I like bland continental breakfasts. She likes sink-water motel coffee. I hope this revelation steers my dreams tonight.
Hey @DJPaulyD, how bout showin' some class for the winner, eh? Somethin' regal, not "pump up the jams." I expected more from you #missusa
And then @xoBetseyJohnson asks Miss Texas, "Why is there something, instead if nothing?" #MissUsa
SC got hosed with that heavy question about treason, while others got softballs. Boo #MissUsa
We ate a lot of meat!! We met Taylor Hicks and Penn Jillette! Why do you hate women so much, @realDonaldTrump #missusa2013
#missusasc our household agrees you're the prettiest. No contest. We're not accredited judges of beauty, or failed comedians, like @MoRocca
So @MoRocca, @realDonaldTrump, @BetseyJohnson, Duck Dynasty person, &amp; that lady from Dream On don't like butts #missusa
@realDonaldTrump "Hey curvy asses! You're fired!!!" #missusa
Hey @realDonaldTrump, the contestants are lovely, but they all have no asses? Why do you like flat asses so much? Feels un-American #missusa

I'm sorry folks. I'm nixing the lyric "you say tomato/I say Chiraq" because it doesn't fit in the song anymore. I'm really sorry about that.

Forced to give up vices due to heavily garnished wages, I invite you to come drink &amp; smoke with me now at Richards. And don't go to college
In one day the gov'm started taking 15% of my dough &amp; the IRS ripped a grand from me. I should be miserable, but I'm enlightened...

Drunk and walking my dog-son Bronson. He just asked.  "Why's the sky so loud to tonight?" I said, "I dunno son, but lets mark it anyway."
Surprised Richard Hell wouldn't reveal his health regimen, cause he's lookin good  @hawleyshoffner understands http://t.co/FqTwkYPVic
I simply prefer peeing in sinks and I think Mother Nature thanks me for it. Plus I'm fucking tall.
I meant "on" top of his game, not "in" top of his game. Guess I picked up that #kriskross spirit after all. The Internet is heartwarming.
The Internet makes people care about celebrities they never cared about anyway. On that note, RIP Chris Kelly. Went out in top of his game.
I'm assuming they're burying the #krisskross guy face down, ass towards heaven? I don't understand contortionists.

I hope the MFA bores at our show tonight die from tainted chamomile tea. Smart kids forgot how to have fun. White trash kids got it going on
So many "prom-themed" parties for grown-ups goin' on. Guess you simps reminisce about dry-humping, puking, and sleeping alone more than me.

I feel old all the time, but the 30th anniversary of "Murmur" really drives the fucking spike in.
A wonderful tribute to a tremendous life. I'm happy to have attended the Roger Ebert memorial tonight.
Hey @rollingstones! What smells like underaged pussy, burnt tempeh, and an absolute inability to truly feel love? YOU!!!
Hey @RollingStones, I just let my dog poop on your lawn...and I didn't pick it up. Even though I had a baggie, I didn't pick it up!
@RollingStones $600 for the cheapest seats? Shame on you for shutting out your real fans.
@RollingStones. I love you, but only rich assholes can afford to see you. Therefore, you should all die now (except for Charlie).
I am the youngest person waiting at the Siskel for tickets to the Ebert memorial. I'm also the poorest person.
All of the dudes at the #ACMs look like rejects from the casting call of "Cruising."
Oops, I always mix up the #CMAs and the #ACMs. It's like confusing vomit with diarrhea. Lordy, I miss real Country music.

@Bottled_Anarchy Probably 11, but the opening acts are killer

Bummed that @SmithWesterns survived.
I want to write epic songs with 20 verses, but I need Bob Dylan's Blood on the Tracks-era cocaine.
When the character pulls out his left earphone, the movie drops the left audio channel. #AttackTheBlock, you really won my heart.
@taco_town I accidentally knocked over some of his $30 glossy pictures. He acted like he needed the money.
The guy who played Charlie in Willy Wonka now looks like @DavidCross's reformed gay character on Mr. Show.
Day at Comic Con: Pissed off Peter Tork. Seduced Mimi Rogers. Took the mic and told the cast of Willy Wonka they looked good & weren't dead.
Going electric tonight: LiveWire Lounge 3394 N Milwaukee. 10 p.m. It'll get nasty.
The guy with the iPad and Rat-at-tat shirt took up two seats, so i just kept farting on his head. Passengers laughed. He didn't notice.

I'm not kidding. Go see Winnie the Pooh. Then write Disney and scold them for dumping a real gem on Potter weekend. #RoyLovesWinnieThePooh
I'm ready to write my "Blood on the Tracks" now. Just waiting for Dylan to die.
Seriously, go see Winnie the Pooh, and scowl at how Disney failed to promote such a great film.
The new Winnie the Pooh movie is Requiem For a Dream For Kids.

Burying my grandma on St. Paddy's Day is like burying Bush on president's day, a fucking insult.
