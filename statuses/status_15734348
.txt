@DrCarolineBrown @theJeremyVine @StopKillingCycl I'm not blaming the victims, but why is there a gender imbalance in the statistics?
@bakerthepatrick @DrCarolineBrown @theJeremyVine @StopKillingCycl Cyclists AND drivers get killed every day on the road. Men AND women.
@DrCarolineBrown @theJeremyVine @StopKillingCycl ... then perhaps the issue has to be addressed with the women cyclists?
@DrCarolineBrown The gender of the victim is not influenced by the driver, therefore if there is a higher proportion of women killed...
@DrCarolineBrown @theJeremyVine @StopKillingCycl @EverydaySexism No.
@DrCarolineBrown @theJeremyVine @StopKillingCycl 6 of 8, that's 75%, so maybe 1 of those four pictures should have been a man.
@theJeremyVine @StopKillingCycl Just happened to pick four successful, attractive women for that post? Sexism is alive and well...

@birdseyemail Great news that you're working on labels! Just to mention that they can be stacked, not just flat as they appear now... :)

Why do people who can't do their job properly think that "I was doing you a favour" is mitigation for fucking up and fucking us over???!??!
Wondering if the writers of #LostFinale got a sneak preview of Ashes To Ashes finale?  Or maybe it was the other way around? Or.............
#LostFinale Anyone who doesn't get it now, you probably never will because there aren't any more explanations!
Seriously dude, could they drag this out any longer? #LostFinale
@PinkTribble good night, hope you get some sleep...! X
@PinkTribble been asleep for not long enough... Urgh!  Lost is getting a bit too obvious!

I just had a great idea for an invention, but really lack the impetus to patent it.  I wonder how many never make it because of laziness?

Just watching Terminator 2 on ITV2 having returned from the cinema to see Salvation.  I remember it being good, but was it really?
@PinkTribble LOL, Hello back!.  My throat is exactly the same, and my nose is alternating between stuffed up and streaming like a tap!
Terminator Salvation: 9/10. UP: Fast paced, action packed, loud, Bale superb as ever.  DOWN: Plot-holes you could lose an Air France jet in.

JB very good!!!
Never seen a queue like this at this theatre before - right round the building. Obviously not many people staying in for Eurovision tonight!

Waiting for Godot with Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellan defintely worth the ticket price! Superb!
If you see me posting the same (or similar) thing twice, it means my twitter client told me it failed and I believed it, not that I'm mad!
@PinkTribble Having been threatened (very effectively I might add) I won't post spoilers for new Star trek movie....
Fuck me, new Star Trek movie I fucking brilliant! Awesome reboot of the franchise and despite the changes, very sympathetic to the original.
New Star Trek is fucking brilliant!!!! Awesome reboot of the franchise! See it!!
Loitering at work waiting for something to do.. :( I'm not even sitting in the office so I can't even letch out the window...

Spent the afternoon with friends on Dunstable Downs.  Shame about the weather, but being British, we carried on with the picnic in the rain!

Boring, boring, boring office.  Oh to be an astronaut! Or a spy. Or a superhero...  Or perhaps just a gigolo! :)
Off to the station to pick up wife and her friend. I think they've had a good night! :)
@PinkTribble Why don't you just block the troublemakers?
At least the sunshine brings out all the local MILFs to watch from the window... :)
Damn, covered in powdered sugar from the cakes Mum brought in for her 60th.  Not good on a black suit, looks like I've been at the Charlie!
Sitting in our Berkhamsted office - on the High Street.  Come and wave at me through the window to brighten up an otherwise boring day...!
Mum is 60 today. Should that make me feel old? It doesn't...
Looking at tweets from others, seems it not just me having trouble with twitter. I feel less victimized now.
@PinkTribble Watched Dogma again last night too. Funny, funny, funny film!
Oh well, perhaps they felt I hadn't said anything interesting enough!  Fuckers.
Fuck, Twatter has cleared 10 days of my updates!  What the fuck was that about??????
Coz some interesting things happened in the last few days, and I doubt I could have imagined them all by myself! :)
Twitter is telling me my last update was 10 days ago...  Am I Bobby Ewing's wife?  Has the last 10 days just been a dream??

Postmen to be fined for dropping those red rubber bands?  Damn it, if they stop dropping them I'm going to have to start paying for them! :)
Ah well, normal service resumes today.  Back to work after 2 weeks off in half an hour. Must.... get.... motivated....!
Had a day off twitter (reading, not posting) yesterday and now have too many tweets to read!  Grrrr....
@mermhart Nice work on the show last night, we thought you were v. funny and wife jealous of you sitting next to Lee. She wants his number..
@ClaudiaWinkle I don't know how you managed to play with that weird cat for so long last night, it looked nasty!
@RealRobBrydon Good show last night, but it really would be easier if you kept track of the score as you went! ;)
@Jason_Manford Good show last night - good job the shirt looked better in real life... :)

Bored waiting for the recording now.... Why no tea or coffee?????
In the queue for Would I Lie To You recording.. ooooh, exciting!!
@RealRobBrydon Looking forward to the filming tonight, should be good!
Bloody F1. Start a race late for the TV audience and pay the price!  Still, nice to see Jenson up there again. Shame it screwed my bets tho!
My god, 3 am has passed and I'm still tweeting!  May soon be time for some shut-eye methinks...  To sleep, perchance to (wet) dream!
@RealDMitchell Get the hell to bed, I'm coming to Pinewood later on and I expect to be entertained!! :)
ITV are looking for nude life models for a new "fine arts" series (yeah right!)..  I'm thinking of auditioning!
@PinkTribble Me too, now we just need another four people....  Maybe not for both encounters! ;)
Why don't they spend some money on putting some public toilets around the towns that are actually open????
OK, so apparently it costs thousands each year for councils to clear up after people urinating in the street..
Blimey, a gay night at a club in Hemel? Whatever next? A hospital with an A&E dept?  Surely not a market place???
@PinkTribble Yes, you can take a gun for CJ!  And I'll save the thorns and come up with something to do with them..  I think you'll like it!
OK, who wants to join with me to form a team to take on the BBC Eggheads?
@PinkTribble Best make sure to take off the thorns then! :O
@PinkTribble A whole quid?  Where do you want me, when should I be there, and where should I put the rose? Between my teeth or between my...
Did meet a star near the stage door on the way in though - Bill Sykes' dog! Bit pretentious though - in make-up outside the theatre..
Oliver! overall - 2 stars out of 5.  Pissed about Rowan Atkinson - for £60 a ticket I would expect them to keep to their commitments.
My review of Oliver!. Disappointing.  No Rowan, despite checking his schedule when booking, amazingly overacted, good set, Jodie v. good.
@nymphomaniac Should we be calling you?  What sort of calls are you taking? :)
@thehhgazette c-.  Is it me or do people get lazier every year?
@gcluley c+. Must try harder next time Graham...
God damn, London beer prices just don't get any better do they?!?
I think I've come to the conclusion that Covent Garden is rubbish unless you're 15 and female. Or you like 15 year old girls!
Train into london again to see Oliver! for my wife's birthday present... http://twitpic.com/2n1ji
@PinkTribble I wouldn't call myself cheap.  I'm inexpensive and therefore accessible to the masses! ;)

@PinkTribble Fast reply! :)
@PinkTribble ... the celeb mags, tabloid press and people who buy them for encouraging these people to keep putting themselves out there?
@PinkTribble Much as I'd like to blame the media whores like the ones you've named, surely the responsibility has to lie with....
Back in bed after a day trip to Southend with wife and dogs.  Wife and I were up for it, dogs not so!  Lovely day though!
Last train of the night from Euston to Hemel. Bloody hell some people talk some real shite on trains. I could really go psycho some nights!

@PinkTribble @mathewhorne It was sort of hypnotic!
@wossy http://twitpic.com/22ncp - What a lovely couple! :)
@mathewhorne @PinkTribble I found that sketch with the burger van strangely erotic...
@PinkTribble My point exactly. It's not one in four is it, it's one in one. We're all connected in one way or another so it affects everyone
1 in 4 people in the UK suffer with some form of mental illness. No. We ALL suffer when a quarter of the population has difficulties.

Enough pontificating!  Word of advice - don't twitter after large quantities Leffe Brune.  But definitely do the Leffe - it's lovely!! :)
@bobbyllew Absolutely.  Change attitudes, change goverments.  On both the continents of Africa and Europe.
That said, there really has to be more to solving Africa's problems than pumping money into mosquito nets....  Much more!
Pragmatism = Darwin & natural selection.  Compassion = Comic Relief & charity.  Shouldn't be that much of a problem to pick one, eh?

Laughing heartily at the chaos ensuing with the Norton community forums because of their lack of response on the PIFTS.exe issue
I doubt Norton is doing anything sinister, it's just that in my experience in IT support I've found it causes more problems than it solves!
Anyone using Norton and having trouble with PIFTS.exe take my advice - uninstall Norton and find another package to replace it now.
@nymphomaniac yeah, hectic! ;)
@nymphomaniac Well it did include a transfer from one office to another and I had to get the online radio stream running first... :)
BBC Radio 2 News today not carrying any stories as good as yesterday. No lunatic ninjas to make me laugh... :(

@thehhgazette "Dacorum Council workers decide to put all the local potholes into one place...."
Damn, just looked at earlier post and realised I failed the "there, their, they're" test! Utterly disgusted with myself.
@PinkTribble Happy Birthday for tomorrow - I know I could say it tomorrow but I'll probably forget!!
Who knew chrome wheels and road salt didn't mix!?! Aparently their great for California, but not Hertfordshire!
@stephenfry Perhaps the vodka would have been better employed before the dancing scene?
Already been called out once tonight already...  Do I dare go to sleep knowing I'll probably get woken up again???  Is this insomnia??
Catching up as I've been so busy for 2 days that I haven't posted..
Ah well, off to work I spose...... :(
@PinkTribble *Jealous*
Why is it that when telesales people call me and ask me a question which I won't answer they seem surprised?
@lilyroseallen Properly bling, but don't expect a Rolex to tell you the correct time!
@richardpbacon Looks more like a side....
@stephenfry Cool, do you get to bring it home?
@PinkTribble A day in bed is never wasted...

Sitting at garage waiting for colleague who left before me but isn't here yet. Funny as there is only one road here!  http://is.gd/iTpc
Bloody hell, do people forget how to drive when they get cold?
@wilw Hey, I take back my scepticism over ice cream floats in beer - Fullers London Porter and Vanilla.... mmmmmm!  Good call!
@GordonTheGopher Evening Gordon - you back from the BAFTAs already?
@PinkTribble "Good actors are like salad - nothing without dressing" for the costume award....
I know @wossy was having trouble with salad, but that was a stretch!
@PinkTribble ooooh, now I'm intrigued!
@PinkTribble You'd only need to be punished if you'd been bad all week...  Have you been bad?
@Klemmie Nah, just a guess! :)  I would have been doing that very same thing in case the game got boring!!
@Klemmie Admit it, you were hoping for the maid to come in again! Hope you enjoyed the game though..
@RichardMadeley Yeah but the scent is always so sickly!
@simon_rim Great recipes today, but do you know why my jam roly-poly at school always used to be grey??
@richardpbacon We thought Connie Fisher was older too so don't feel bad about that question...
@PinkTribble Yeah, that's rough but its always better the next time...!
@RealJamesMay James, you really don't want to be following everyone who follows you - hell I struggle with just a few! Pick the good ones...
@PinkTribble Late reply I know but why would you require punishment for being unemployed? I'm not in government you know!!
@CHRISDJMOYLES Now he looks like a sad axe murderer....!
Settling down after a dinner of dressed crab and a night of tv.. Total Wipeout good for a laugh, CSI getting worse, QI funny as ever! Night.
Eaten too much breakfast! Changed my mobile contract yesterday to include 1Gb of data per month... Reckon that will be enough to twitter?
@Klemmie Ah there is the problem, you don't want to look for a sports bar, you want a good, real ale pub full of rugby fans, can't beat it!
@Klemmie Don't go back to the hotel, find a pub showing the game and enjoy the atmosphere!
Actually Hemel Hempstead can inspire one - to move somewhere else!?!
@RealJamesMay Have a great weekend. Unfortunately Hemel Hempstead isn't inspiring in any way at all...
@PinkTribble Careful, if James' agent thinks you're trying to find out what he's doing, he'll make him cancel his twitter account!! :)
@PinkTribble Sorry to hear you're poorly - it only happens on a weekend so as to not interfere with your career plans..  Yeah, really!
@richardpbacon Quarter Cheese surely?  Not chicken, what's the point?  Gotta be something with four legs....
Snowy %26 slushy everywhere and still I get to the crem early! Damn I'm good!
@PinkTribble I think I'd be excited by that too - he's an influential character in tv land - he has the ear of @schofe...  I need help too!
Should I be excited that a genuine TV celeb is following me?  Well it's probably not cool to admit it, but yeah, I am! Who needs to be cool?
@wilw How about mint choc chip in a bottle of Bud? Hell, anything could improve Bud.....
@wilw Well I suppose that could be ok, but why spoil a good beer with ice cream?
Aren't surprise gifts always the best?  You know, the ones that you get without expecting them and without any particular reason. Thank you!
@xxandip Nice shirt, can they be bought at officialphillipschofield.com or will there be a rival officialandipeters.com?
@RealJamesMay Time for a new agent maybe?
@Wossy How about "punani" for the BAFTAs or if you want something clean, "spectacles"..
Loving Walking on a Dream by Empire of the Sun!
@amandapalmer Censorship rules OK!  Seriously, people need to get a life and stop telling us what's good for us to see and hear!
Has left his phone somewhere.  How naked I feel!
Starting to get the idea of Twitter now, interesting, pointless and addictive are just three words I can fit into this tweet!
@stephenfry http://twitpic.com/1bgp1 - Damn, I didn't realise that the lifts around here were so prehistoric!  All we get is buttons doo ...
@stephenfry http://twitpic.com/1bgnt - Why is it that I never get stuck in a lift with anyone interesting?
Snowball fight outside the church anyone? No? Chickens!!
Thinking it may be time to replace the iPaq hw6915 with something new. Needs to be Windows Mobile, GPS and WiFi. Ideas?
http://twitpic.com/1am6y - Great view from my window of the cars all over the road. Why do I feel the urge to go out and laugh? Idiots!
Can't believe the people who are so in love with their 4 wheels that they can't tell when it's just not going to happen!
Phil Taylor just gets boring...
@Schofe Great tie though!
Back from helping with the black-magic that is HDTV!
Killing time at work
