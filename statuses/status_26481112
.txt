@sloncar here the bookies prefer Spain but I think I'll place my bet on the Dutch, so if they win that gives more ROI.
@sloncar and now it comes the real test of your octopus power:- can you predict who will win the world cup final? - I may place a £10 bet
@sloncar and that's it - It is over for Germany, and Spain are going to the final
@sloncar 90 minutes + 3 extra minutes, but Spain are just eating up the clock.
@sloncar it looks like the octopus was right (again)
@sloncar Spain 1:0 nice goal by Puyol
@sloncar wow this was great
@sloncar Spain are blocking the German game. A bit boring as there are no goals - lack of end product. But there are numerous passing ;(
@sloncar r u watching? what do you think so far?
@sloncar it is now ... 3:2 to Holland, they've done it
@sloncar Pereira scores to reduce the difference and it is 3:2 to Holland in 92minute
@sloncar Forlan subsd by Fernandez. Uruguay are exhausted, they've got nothing left. The Dutch are doing the attacking
@sloncar your predictions seems right (again) it is now 3:1 but it would seem that you know that already
@sloncar and the Dutch are back to life ... Sneijder 2:1 (maybe just a little bit offside) but it stands
@sloncar Uruguay definitely look the more dangerous of the teams at the moment
@sloncar Fantastic Forlan 1:1 also a stunning goal
@sloncar stunning goal from some distance, Van Bronckhorst, a perfect goal for Holland
@sloncar URU giving as good as they're getting, so far very equal
#worldcup during the national anthem the Dutch seemed a bit worried, whilst the URU seemed a lot more confident ;) so we can already predict
C'mon Uruguay! ... or Holland! ... oh well, it doesn't really matter ;)) just enjoy! #worldcup

@sloncar only a light touch ... completely by accident ... did not even change the course of the ball
@sloncar sorry but this was a goal gift from the referee to Ghana undeserved
@sloncar that was a good chance ..yes - we need more of that - but better please!
@sloncar what amoron - That was the most stupid thing rghhh!
@sloncar zigic out - hajde da vidimo sad dal'ce malo bolje
@sloncar If they continue like this there will be a goal for Ghana very soon
@sloncar that was a joke of course
I'm no expert, but if I was Antic, I'd tell the Serbian team to try and score a goal.
@sloncar SRB are improving, good defence and putting some more pressure on
@sloncar what do u think so far?
@sloncar I agree ... a lot will depend on who scores the first goal ..
@sloncar R u watching Serbia - Ghana? starting now?
