I'll be spending the extra $100 to get the #Xboxone from a company who already has the gaming business down

I mean they got hacked...at least they're taking some notes from Xbox though.
Why waste money &amp; hours of your life on a console from a company that doesn't know how to use it themselves...
....and 360 still out performed it. Offline and online.
It's still not appealing to me when the ps3 also contained "better hardware" and was more "powerful" than the 360....
Tried reading more into the #ps4 since they boast about having better hardware under the hood therefore making it faster.
