@liam_tomkins suar taste! Already been done
@mihail_v you are correct. First half we had far too much pointless possession, struggled to get out of our own half. Second half was awful
@Jack_Sear_ Suarez against evra. Tasty
The biggest thing that pissed me off about that game was Jon champion and Chris waddle saying how brilliant we were when we were very poor!
Why is handball only cheating if you do it to score or prevent a goal? No ones arsed the rest of the time
Lucas had an absolute shocker. One of his worst performances in a long time. Needs to step it up with our fixtures coming up
Suarez handball or Utd fans chanting 'murderers'? What will get more attention? I think we all know

@alisonkingkenny learnt it off Suarez, obviously
@christrfrost hasn't committed a single foul this season! #how
@nathangreen1892 surprised me how bad he was tonight
Carroll, 35m, on loan at west ham.
Downing, 20m, more use as a left back.
Henderson, 16m, more use as a right back.

How depressing.
@CarinaAnders 90k a week, just get rid. Downing is the most ineffective player ever. Shelvey is 20 and shows more guts and passion than both
@CarinaAnders no really, it's the personnel. The sooner we see the back of cole and downing the better
@Andrew_Heaton the only reason the owners were careful this transfer window was cause of the travesty that was Carroll, downing and hendo
@Ezizallamov 16m utility player on 70k
@LucasLeiva87 get well soon Mr Lucas. How we could have done with you tonight
@pauldalglish shocking 1st half. Lots of pressure in the last 20 mins but they countered well. Allen was terrible, downing open goal miss
Literally every time we lost possession we were getting hit on the counter. Allen had a shocker, Michu nicked it off him about 5 times! #LFC
@pauledwards1973 Suarez? Downing missed an open goal from 6 yards...

Pinpoint gerrard corner, right on the centre of the six yard line. Rooneys wispy hair does the rest
@WorHorse crazy how much he gets slated, far better than people give him credit for. He has lapses but he's one of the best RBs
Why doesn't Torres reveal this 'truth' he keeps harping on about? I think it's obvious he was forced out of the club, same with Carroll, ¬£¬£¬£

@DJSpoony no!! Agger is perfect for BR's system and I think Johnson is overrated. Wouldn't be much of an upgrade on downing, too similar
@darrenbyfield @leonmitchell @football__stat he's not a creator, he's a dictator
@Jack_Sear_ @transferupdate let's fucking hope so
@Tom_fairclough9 definitely not. He came back a much better player than when he was first here and played well pretty much every game

Did they all just cheer the same player they were booing?
@Mark__Bright the way you were banging on about how unfit Suarez was you would never have thought he scored a hat trick vs chile 2 weeks ago
Haha Morgan's got some balls #lfc
Nice feet from Morgan #lfc
@terenceeley suso is on the right..
@CavanaghAI11 it's 0-0, if you're wondering :D
Thierry Henry's accent is very sexy #lfc
@Jack_Sear_ thought aquilani was fairly anonymous and McLaughlin suspect defensively, good on the ball though. Others impressed though #lfc
I can't believe carra still hasn't learned to move his feet when in possession, he just plants his standing foot and swivels #lfc
Wtf! Taddie loves the limp hand gesture! #lfc
@WorHorse I'd be glad to see the back of both really, both on high wages, both  injury prone
Taddei just did the gayest limp hand gesture towards the ref #lfc
Wasn't an easy chance but should have scored #lfc
@terenceeley hardly, 7/8 are part of the first team squad
Carra scythes someone down and gets away with it but sterling encroaches and gets booked #commonsense #lfc

@LFCKirstyLFC Dempsey is a good player :-) in his prime, versatile, can score a variety of goals. Very good in the air, works hard and cheap
@LFCKirstyLFC our fans are odd. Carefree about good players like Dempsey. Get overexcited by expensive ones like downing, Carroll and cole..
@MartinLipton but it was the FA who chose this 'independent' panel. The issue of racism in footy had become too sensitive, they had to act.
@MartinLipton as a Liverpool fan it felt like Suarez was found guilty by the media long before the verdict. The FA had to make a statement
@MartinLipton had the roles been reversed and the terry case dealt with by the FA do you think he would have been slaughtered like Suarez?
@MostarLFC looks like they've replaced Lucas' leg with a fake one! We can rebuild him..
@Robish13 we'll make it back in shirt sales, especially as we are currently on tour in the US

@pauledwards1973 @liencam at least two, one has played in the CL
6-0, Jesus Christ! Heads have well and truly dropped.
This scoreline is so unjust
@Red_At_Heart yep, it's about preparing individuals for the first team
@woolfc I missed the first 10 mins but we've probably been the better team..
So unlucky from suso, great strike
Terrible goalkeeping

@jamesgerrard approach play is good. Not enough players in the box, no composure, no conviction... Need to improve in the final third
Why do people think a goal scorer will suddenly sort out our problems? Yes we need a striker but there's a lack of goals throughout #LFC
Utd have 29 away goals, we have 30 goals in total... #LFC
Spurs team is poor.

@hannahd20 it needs no mention, everyone knows he's got style
Why was there no mention of Arsenal having a player down every five minutes? There should have been at least 10 minutes of stoppage time!
@DanKennett would you class rvps second as a CCC?
@DanKennett was Suarez hitting the post a CCC? Or skrtels header from the corner? We are so profligate
@DanKennett what constitutes a clear cut chance?
@DanKennett composure luis!!
@Jack_Sear_LFC like comolli said, we just need one or two tweaks which hopefully means two top players.
@Jack_Sear_LFC he's a good player but I don't think just buying a goalscorer will sort everything out
@Jack_Sear_LFC failed at two big clubs though and he's not that young
How the hell did carra let RVP get goalside for the 1st? Really poor defending
@Jack_Sear_LFC can't agree with you on spearing, he's not intelligent enough to play as a DM, too naive. Impressed me this season though
@scouserchick_ anyone who gives him shit needs their head testing. Our performances are good, we just lack a bit of quality
@Jack_Sear_LFC hes a better target man than Carroll! Suarez is very strong, very good at rolling defenders
@Jack_Sear_LFC world class! Praying he stays and we can get some quality additions in the summer! Cavani and hazard please
@pauledwards1973 people leaving their seats during a game is infuriating! People were constantly doing it at wembley, watch the fucking game
@SkySportsFraser mate, Liverpool fans have felt like that every weekend!
We can take lots of positives from our performances this season, 2/3 quality attacking additions and next season will be interesting #LFC
Very good performance. Created good chances. Wasteful as usual. Carragher at fault for both goals. Gutted. #LFC
@Jack_Sear_LFC at least we won't be pinging balls in the box from ridiculous angles!

@daniellewarren amazing isn't it? Unfortunately it had to be done.

@LadySG so terry gets a fair trial simply because it was reported to the police? Will the FA conduct their own investigation after the trial
@StanCollymore the apologies are to defuse the situation, it's all gone too far. Our stance is still the same
‚Äú@thejamessutton: Im sorry. #LFC‚Äù me too, sincerely.
@LadySG which makes me think man utd knew what they were doing by not going to the police. We handled it very naively
@Freakysid but it's a criminal offence, surely the FA should have left it to the police?
Can anyone tell me why the Suarez case didn't go straight to the police like Terry and others before? #LFC

RT @briankettle: Wonder if Suarez has heard about the statement he wrote yet?

@gina_pina_14 no chance, as long as he's still here we'll always be reminded of it. Can see him moving to barca or real in the summer
@gina_pina_14 best thing we can do now is concentrate on the football, get 4th place and win both cups!

@Mark__Bright Liverpool could only appeal the length of the ban, not the verdict. Liverpool did what was right in the end, lots of pressure
@Mark__Bright also is that enough to condemn a man as a racist? Suarez's honesty got him in trouble, should he have denied it?!
@Mark__Bright why would he admit to using the word 'negro' yet still proclaim his innocence? He clearly believes the word isn't derogatory
@Mark__Bright in a civil court, yes. If it had gone to a criminal court it would have been thrown out for lack of evidence.
@Mark__Bright Liverpool backed a man guilty based on the 'balance of probabilities'. Have you even read the report in full?
