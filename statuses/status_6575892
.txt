Dunno mebbe they were. Would justify the pricettag.
$7 for a drink special. who knew. #thelocusisnotthebariknew
imagine my chagrin. arrive home and see my shirt gaping open. i wish people would say something, even if it's a bit embarassing. it's kinder
Shuffle shuffle pause pause choose. What is this indecisive nonsense? See a seat take it. And so on. It's public transit, a seat is a seat.
Seen at the show and shine, especially liked the jewelry she was wearing Saniki Creations http://t.co/4cQV54M via @wibiya
Taking a bevie break from the show n shine.
Picked up cheap sony headphones one day cuz forgot my shure's at home. sony's kick the $$$$ shure's butt, and they don't fall outa my ears.
Today stop by Bikram's and check it out. Too late for the summer body, but I am curious enough to give it a try hypertension or no. #bikrams
On the "to do" list: find items apparently "lost" during move. Note to self, re-examine how much of this stuff is needed before next move.
i know it kinda looks like i got beat up. but really, not to worry folks, just some facial landscaping is all. #threadingisnotforsissies
And so after all this time the answer is that there is no answer.
A conversation with a neighbour inspired me again to think outside the box. I'm thinking again of alternatives of where to go from here.
I walk past a brand new parking lot and realize I can't remember what used to be there before.
Quay beginning 2 take shape. Donald's, crepes, tea n tiny. Soon gelato, seafood, a bakery join the mix.2day a rainy day retreat.#rivermarket
Tough realization but true. Mine is not a summer ready body.
Carried a letter around with me for awhile; needed a stamp before I could mail it. Got the stamp, but now it's going nowhere.#postalstrike
delivered pizza should not require heating upon its arrival. time to rethink patronage of one of the the local restaurants. #ginosrestaurant
Just finished reading "Still Alice". A heartbreaking, poignant pageturner.#stillalice #alzheimer
the idea of half hour lunches sounded great until i started taking them. now they seem much too short.
woman in office coughing--wretching continuous for wks. dire. gave me a document with spittle on it, expected 2 c blood. disturbing.
Watching hockey; having a beer. How Canadian am I?
if the sun can make up its mind about being in front of the clouds it would be a very nice day......finally.
Guy sits in seat. Tosses paper on it to floor. Another guy sits; picks it up stows it --2 recycle? which guy would u rather b ur neighbour?
older gent curved over handlebars of a girls bike whizzes past me. not the kind without the top bar; a tiny pink number with white wheels.
Smoking stinks. It's bad for everyone's health; butts r left littered. It is not a right but an abused privilege. Smoke at home if you must.
A coffee maker that manages to brew quality coffee and crappy coffee tasting the same is not a good coffee maker.
It took a theft, our loss and my bitching to get it done but our storage room now sports a deadbolt. Case of the barn door and the horse.
...traffic noise cuts into the bliss.
Trotting around Burnaby lake.
Amelia Cafe Saturday afternoon http://spo.gs/o5pf
2 glasses in on Blasted Church. Yum-o.#BCwine
I know I'm OK but I know there are those who are better. That's not going to stop me from doing my thing.
Maybe I am not clever enough to appreciate this humour. The motto reads "our quality justify our prices" in ur face  potential  customers!
Another year. What will I do this year that will be memorable? Make me wiser?
Planning staycation activities for next week. Got a jaunt around Burnaby Lake so far. Looking for some Vancouver on the cheap to do.
Lost. Ask passersby for directions. Scratch that; attempt. He walks by and doesn't acknowledge. Not even slightly.#aliensfromanotherplanet?

Posted my first item offer on @freecycle hopefully someone takes it off my hands. Otherwise. I'll have to return-it! #reducereuserecycle
Going voting.
Fin Donnelly and his campaign people are jockeying with the Jesus lady st sixth and sixth to get his msg across.#ndp
People are breaking out the flip flops and shorts. Is it OK to say that some people do not wear short shorts very well? #fashioncriminals
My feet are burning, aching and giving me major grief, but it was a great walkabout.#streethiking

I've got a song stuck in my head, and that's a good thing. Distracts me from my puffy eyes.
Just settled in nice and train is taken out of service. Giant crowd forming for next that comes.#skytrain
Empty train. Whole lotta people are still in bed, but they'll wake up to rain.
"do not let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do." John Wooden. should listen to the man and just go for it already. #quotes.
if you can avoid renting from @CAPREIT then do. properties are poorly managed and shoddy & they never respond to concerns or queries. never.
True but fans gotta be fans in good times and bad. Positive energy works better than negative.
Motherf***ers broke into our storage locker. I hate thieves!! Lowlife vermin scum. Worse, some neighbour let the worthless piece of crap in.
reminded again that i had a goal to walk the camino before i turn 50. not getting any younger. better get cracking. #walkingcaminodesantiago
Give this a spin for kicks, it doesn't hurt at all and is full of pretty colours. Tweet Topic Explorer http://t.co/xkldwP9 via @JeffClark
@matt1533 people r fallin off the bandwagon faster than u can say Canucks. If the 'nucks have a rep so do most fans. whaddya think? #canucks
following Marlee Matlin and a few more celebrities not because i really am into that, perhaps there's intersect in our lives & they inspire.
Come on Canucks fans.... make some NOISE!!! Cheer on your team!! And Canucks...get into it already!!!!!!#Canucks #nhlplayoffs
Come on Canucks get aggressive! Play like you wanna win! #nhlplayoffs
S/Bux near work is finally engaged in some form of recycling but with only one dedicated receptacle out of 5 just how serious is the effort?
It seems that some people equate brisk efficiency with being brusque.
Frigid clear morning bodes well for warm and sunny evening, I hope. Walking part way home 2night; part of plan to get exercise "by default".
*yawn*
friday home stretch and i can't wait. just about there...almost. ended the day with correcting other people's math and i am no math teacher.
Cutting down on the cream in my  coffee. Not too jazzed with the new taste sensation, but its the most I can muster in willpower these days.
working on paring down following list so i am not so inundated with tweets but i realize i don't want to and i'll just have to live with it.
That's it. It's over? Weekends are far too short. Usual Monday afflictions: fatigue, aches and pains with a hint of nauseousness.
Hit the flea market wall, figuratively and literally. Some blue glass baublles I want at last and classiest booth, but I'm opting for tea.
Japanese man berates daughter as we wait and onboard. Don't get the cultural why. Wanted to say something. Hard 2 witness, imagine her pain.
about to dive into The Kite Runner. Looking forward to a good read. #books
Skytrain fare spot check. I'd still have to dig out my pass if there were turnstiles, but I'd probably not have it buried so deep in my bag.
The expensive orthotics are doing nothing for the agony in my foot. Bad enough they only fit in two pairs of shoes I own. Time for Plan B.
all full of mashed parmesan cauliflower potatoes. decadent yummy goodness.
tried #farmville, computer didn't like it. time to finish mealplan. tasty recipes #foodonthetable #chatelaine. now just to shop and cook it.
Lunch's green onions won't go away.
Getting off train woman I work with kept dirty Kleenex til she passed all garbages, then dropped it on the ground outside station.#littering
Installed update for Wordpress mobile. Have yet to crack the app even once. Bad, lazy d. #wordpress
Runners dammit, runners!! Muddy runners....*sigh*
Guy on skytrain wearing muddy tinners, carrying a Gucci messenger bag and a milk jug of water. A study in contrasts?
Just discovered why--on a work morning, of course--why I haven't pressed my travel daypack into service before. Not enough pockets.
Picked up The Kite Runner at NWPL. Got a couple more books. A  Stephen Fry; see if his fiction is as good as his humour.#books #Stephenfry
Spent some time trying to figure out the great mysteries of Twitter. So I spent some time, still don't know squat. I'll need more; lots more
