@JudNichols Not at all! Foolish decisions can certainly cause more problems than a lack of teachable skills.

@JudNichols ...of the group, however if it were only team players and no survival skills, people probably wouldn't last very long either.
@JudNichols interesting idea! I certainly agree that people who add to (and aid) a group dynamic like this are essential to the survival ...
@TaylorCole93 are you really still trying to say you were right?
@JudNichols I've had snake, but never like that. How was it?
@JudNichols @muskratlady @BenjiLanpher I'm impressed you didn't shy away from that at all!
Is this going to turn into Lord of the Flies? #TheIsland
Despite my hatred of the all-male show, I appreciate the attractive attorney who cites Google as a survival tool. #TheIsland
About to start the first episode of #TheIsland and I'm definitely starting off by hating it because it's only men. Let's see what happens...
"Has the modern man gone soft?" I don't know, but is the modern women assumed to be too soft to start? @BearGrylls #TheIsland
@TheJeffDodge That's what I was thinking before the season began! I'm about to start 1st ep, but why would I be unable to survive?#TheIsland

It's ridiculous that anybody is making a big deal about this. https://t.co/HmKmvZJRie

@jasonwhyte do you mean in the photo of Sgt Al Powell from Die Hard? There's more personality of his character than in my photo.
@jasonwhyte I know but still, I don't see any personality in that photo. It's just‚Ä¶ a photo of a person. It's rather bland in that aspect.

@jasonwhyte I don't mean good photos. Obviously that's part of it, but I definitely don't have any photos of myself that fit.

@tvwritergirl probably wouldn't qualify, because I haven't been doing work that suits that
@tvwritergirl thanks. I'm back at uni in another city Sept 1, so I can't even look for another job, who hires for six weeks?
@tvwritergirl already been off two weeks, already stir crazy. Vacation is fine, but I'm just sitting at home doing nothing because‚Ä¶ money :/
Suddenly very depressed. No work for another week (or possibly all summer) is going to kill me.
I just for $100 from the BC government‚Ä¶ so that's nice!
@ChickenMclovin it was fun but I'm pissed that it took so long to get home.
FINALLY on our way home after a ridiculous night‚Ä¶ I'm just so done right now.

So I've finished GoT‚Ä¶ what am I going to read now?
@pennesthoughts @leafsweetie @JacobsCreekCA @MommyGearest I'm a non-Drew fan too!
@geekgrrl33 gah, but when I casually watch an episode I liked Eli!
RT @sossamcro: In other news, Mike Vogel is looking dashing as always. #UnderTheDome
Watching the newest episode of @UnderTheDomeCBS! One of my favourite shows of summer.
@andersonwci would be more entertaining!
Loving @sdobbins21 on @NBCSiberia! I'd trust him. Maybe. Can you really trust anyone‚Ä¶? #Siberia can't wait for next week!
What is with this Sabina girl! Definitely suspicious‚Ä¶ @NBCSiberia #Siberia
Seriously that cave Daniel found is freaking me out though. @NBCSiberia #Siberia
I love this Neeko guy! And Brooklyn Sam. Possibly two favourites! @NBCSiberia #Siberia
@andersonwci exactly. Perhaps it's Daniel as a shocker!
Does Johnny look like a serial killer or is it just me? @NBCSiberia #Siberia
@NBCSiberia ah yes, of course! Salmon definitely makes it more manly!
Pink-suit George is the only person to leave @NBCSiberia? Meh, now lets bring on the drama! #Siberia
And now, it's time for @NBCSiberia! #livetweets #siberia
@ItnJob I'm definitely happy that Michael has left now. But this after the rose discussion is awful.
@JacobsCreekCA @Collin_Dsouza89 @Jenmendes33 @plumerea @casstriumbari @pennesthoughts @KaleyS23 definitely excited for next week!
RT @JacobsCreekCA: Team #MoscatoMonday: best night ever! @Collin_Dsouza89 @Jenmendes33 @reviewsbylauren @plumerea @casstriumbari @pennestho‚Ä¶
@JacobsCreekCA that's definitely what I'm thinking too!
I'm not sure how I feel about her dress‚Ä¶ #thebachelorette
@JacobsCreekCA who are your final two picks, and who do you think she gets engaged to?
@ItnJob I always see her with Chris. I've gone a complete 180¬∞! Used to hate Chris and now he's my #1 pick! #thebachelorette
RT @JacobsCreekCA: Oh dear, sweet, fast-talking Michael. Here's how we see you, in our dreams. Buh-bye #MoscatoMonday #bachelorette http://‚Ä¶
@ItnJob I am! But‚Ä¶ #TeamChris!
@JacobsCreekCA I am! But‚Ä¶ I've become #TeamChris! I've been #TeamZak since the beginning though. #thebachelorette
Why is Michael always so shiny? #thebachelorette
@JacobsCreekCA why are you so massive on Drew? Definitely not seeing it!
I'm surprised that Michael is still on #thebachelorette‚Ä¶ is this their first kiss?
So could Chris NOT use a poem to tell her he loved her? It is cute though. #thebachelorette
The second sequinned skirt of the show! Wow‚Ä¶ distracting! #thebachelorette
This Chris date is already going so much better than the Brooks one! Doesn't the whole poem thing get a little tired, tho? #thebachelorette
Wow, Chris is really really really really excited? #thebachelorette
Will Brooks and Desiree recapture the sizzle? #thebachelorette #livetweets
I love that Chris is perturbed by the Des and Brooks date. I'm LOVING Chris lately. #thebachelorette #livetweets
@JacobsCreekCA it was a bit ridiculous though.
I'll be watching @BacheloretteABC tonight starting in a few minutes and #livetweeting! Any predictions for who gets sent home?
Why am I watching this @Mistresses_ABC shit? Such a bad show!
#bachelorette viewing party with mum! Adding some @JacobsCreekCA #MoscatoMonday to make it even better! One hour until the show! :)
Of course we have the Aussie tunes playing. We love our INXS!
And we're off to Cultus for the day. Only half an hour late today!
@agha_zulfikar no. I said they're way too hot to wear, but they're very Canadian. You know, because it was Canada day?
RT @Libras_R_Us: #Libras like to keep ahold of their inner child for their whole life.
@geekgrrl33 it should be! Beach day :)
Trying not to have a panic. Today has been awful. I wish I just stayed in bed rather than getting up at 6:30, ugh.
@ItnJob I went to the beach for Canada day and watched Independence Day on July 4th. Still mad I don't get to see more @JuanPaGalavis!
@geekgrrl33 @HRCtweets a while ago I tried and failed, and haven't tried since because haven't had need
A man that looks like Stan Lee is on my bus‚Ä¶
@jasonwhyte because why would you really want to?
So happy there was no confrontation required when returning that‚Ä¶ forever happy with forever yours.
It's 20¬∞ and I'm complaining that it's freezing cold. Ya sure ok
Well that was a fun game to watch! #wimblendon2013 @DjokerNole @delpotrojuan
My only 4th of July tradition is watching Independence Day every year. Have to say its a great way to spend the non-holiday.
FINALLY pulling out my summer clothes &amp; putting away the winter ones. Lots of random photos on Instagram because of it.
@ItnJob LOTS of crying.
@LaurenLabh it's spectacular! I'm great for suggestions.
Bachelorette, Whodunnit, Under the Dome, Saving Hope, and Siberia all in one day. Definitely busy. At least it was fun!
@ItnJob hopefully it all works itself out!
Watching the premiere of @NBCSiberia and it's great. "I'm going to break him slowly‚Ä¶" ah Montenegro, you kill me.
Watching the second @ABCWhodunnit episode with the family. Sucks to be Dontae!
@ItnJob maybe, but if it's beachy then it's probably the week after families... I don't know, it could also be next week in the island.
@ItnJob my mum thought maybe he realized he's not into her, because he's just been protecting her so far.
@ItnJob I know‚Ä¶ looks like he gets past hometown dates though, it was all beachy. So he still makes it another 2 weeks before leaving.
@ItnJob those previews were crazy. What's going on! Hope it all ends up alright! Poor lovely men!
@LaurenLabh thanks! I'm living in Vancouver, but I'm originally from Adelaide, Australia.
Sometimes I feel as though I'm on my own personal Bachelorette show - I guess I should explain. http://t.co/XgreNFOs6q
@LaurenLabh Juan Pablo was great! I've actually liked Zak since the beginning as well... I just put up a review of the episode actually.
Sad that @JuanPaGalavis is no longer on #bachelorette, I loved getting to see him each week!
@LaurenLabh definitely a Lauren thing! Who are you liking this season?
@ItnJob YOU'RE SO RIGHT! The Drew kisses are adorable!
Finally watching #Bachelorette. Definitely excited for a Zak date!
And shut down again. I forgot I wasn't allowed to talk to my mother. Ever. About anything.
@ItnJob I haven't got to watch it yet, I was off celebrating Canada day, excited to see Drew rock a date though! I'll watch today :)
So today has been really awesome. Even if I'm a little burnt.
Off to the beach! Happy Canada day! #canadaday #happycanadaday #canada #beach #sun #summer #whiterock http://t.co/vPsgRFaaf3
Way too hot to wear these, but they're definitely the most Canadian thing I own. #canada #gloves‚Ä¶ http://t.co/T5rSsQGpB4
Can take the girl outta Oz but you can't take the Oz outta the girl, definitely bringing an Aussie flag towel to the beach for Canada day.
Celebrating Canada day at the beach. Every time I see the boy we end up drinking beer, yet today he says he WON'T be bringing any? WTF!?!

@ABCWhodunnit actually looks rather fun! Maybe I'll continue to watch it.
Under the Dome looks really fun.
@geekgrrl33 nope, but I wouldn't be surprised if it got that way
@geekgrrl33 oh joy!
Watching first episode of Under the Dome with the parents and oh my god naked people and sex‚Ä¶ way to immediately make it awkward.
Just saw an ad for these Zoomies binocular glasses‚Ä¶ most hilarious daytime infomercial ever.

Love that the word classy has become the exact opposite of what it's supposed to mean.
@jasonwhyte I haven't seen the purge and really didn't want to‚Ä¶
@jasonwhyte ya and it's crapped out at the box office. WHD definitely had a Die Hard in the White House vibe which was fun.
@jasonwhyte haven't seen OHF but Butler isn't as attractive as Tatum. AND it ain't John McClane if it ain't Bruce Willis.
@jasonwhyte I know there's always predictability, and I seem to be predicting way more than I should be in movies lately, but oh well.
@jasonwhyte so much fun! I love me some Channing, but generally it was fun as well. I did predict basically everything that happened though‚Ä¶
Just saw @channingtatum in #WHD and it was loads of fun, can I rewatch it yet? #whitehousedown #movies #fun

@jasonwhyte how was White House Down? I'm seeing it tonight at the drive in
I can't believe I just spent $200 on clothes.
@agilbertbc like WTF?
@ItnJob Australia is 'home' but I left really young. I was back last year and it was amazing,I'm already desperate to get back to traveling!
@itentertainsme yeah we're awesome. No big deal! PS: dead-icated. Now that was great.

@DanicaSheard very good!
@ItnJob ya, Vancouver. What about you?
I really need to write up an explanation of the #roommatechronicles from the last semester on theschoolobsessions.
@DanicaSheard you have the same three and me and @ItnJob!
@ItnJob yes‚Ä¶ only time will tell! Do you watch at PST or EST?
@DannyKanes exactly!
Almost finished 4th cabinet of the day and it's only 330. The plan was to leave at 5 and so 3.5 cabinets. ‚Ä¶should I leave early?
@ItnJob we have such similar opinions on this season, that's great!
@DanicaSheard who are your picks for the final three on #bachelorette ?
@ItnJob hmmm‚Ä¶ Zak, Chris, and Brooks. Perhaps Juan Pablo will sneak in there, he's kind of the dark horse of the season. Who are your picks?
‚Ä¶I was just told the world would be a better place with more people like me. Suuuure
@ItnJob definitely! I'm excited, I think he'll go to the end.

Watching #sytycd and that #sytycdcontemporary with Alan and Jasmine M was beautiful!
@ItnJob looks like Zak gets the one on one next week!
@ItnJob I figured Zak had more depth so I didn't judge him too much &amp; put him in favourites from the start. Juan Pablo is loveable, exactly
@ItnJob definitely both need to leave! My two favourites are Zak and Juan Pablo. Clearly Zak is the only contender of those that we see...

LOVE the new bikini top! #blue #turquoise #aqua #bikini #top #clothes #swimwear #swim #fashion‚Ä¶ http://t.co/OSPSpfaK8Q
So happy! Now I have a new bikini top and some more cute little animal things. Good description, photo coming soon.
I have been having such morbid thoughts of late.
@geekgrrl33 while at school I totally agree. Perhaps putting them on is dressing up, because I'm normally home in sweats.
@leg_stand great! I'll let you know soon what day works :)
@geekgrrl33 they're so great. I love my lululemon
Waking behind these high schoolers and they're so immature oh my god.
It's been a max of two hours and I've done 700 files already? Great! I deserve a break now, right?
I just want to go home and sleep. Maybe read a little as well. Definitely don't want to look at any computers/iPads though.
The faster I get through 1500 files the faster I'll be able to leave. Hmmmmm
@jasonwhyte I was waiting for you to comment, it's the only reason I mentioned it. I want to but 2am is WAY too late for me.
@geekgrrl33 I wore yoga pants so at least I was dry soon after walking in.
@jasonwhyte thankfully there were no wet songs. I dodged all the big puddles :)
Super sluggish today, I guess my goal is being knocked back to 1500 unless I get into it again.
Wow this rain is glorious. I always wanted to show up to work looking soggy.
If you want to see @onedirection live in Vancouver then enter the contest here! http://t.co/c0k7VHnLpp
So I have the option to see Evil Dead on Friday or Saturday at 2am at a drive in‚Ä¶ this might terrify me too much.
@DanicaSheard yeah, Ben is definitely seeming like the bad guy now though.
@leg_stand thanks! When does it go until? I'm working on dates I'm available right now :)
RT @Girl_MeetsWorld: RT if you still love Boy Meets World.
@owlcity incredibly hurt you're not doing the West Coast! Vancouver/Victoria needs love too!
@TheConjuring @wbpictures because that isn't utterly terrifying‚Ä¶
I've already done 300 files today. In one hour! I feel successful :) goal is 2200 for the day, so that should be EASY.
@MrAaronAbrams same outfit too?
@GirlCalledRach @CW_network @The_Hillary @ATXFestival well that sounds awesome!
@GirlCalledRach @itentertainsme BUT SERIOUSLY THOUGH
@rochelleaytes might have been one of the only acceptable things about Mistresses. Check out my review on @TheReviewWeekly tomorrow!
My 2013 Reading Challenge! http://t.co/AG8EEb8q4a
@owlcity maybe later
@DanicaSheard my review just posted (http://t.co/urcC84t0I0) but Zak W and Brandon from last episode,also like Drew and Juan Pablo (so HOT).
@DanicaSheard he was cute! At least my best favourites are still there :)
@TootlessWonderS seriously just stop. I don't care.
@TootlessWonderS did you seriously want me to watch something that's an hour long? How crazy are you.
@KalonMcM @LindziCox glad someone else noticed it! Even with the sketchy "oh no, where are we?"
@FeedingBackTV @Carleygomez he's definitely there for the wrong reasons. He's very‚Ä¶ smarmy?
RT @FeedingBackTV: Who is this dude, Nick M? You can't be that hurt, you didn't even brush shoulders with Des, let alone have a connection.‚Ä¶
RT @FeedingBackTV: UGGGGHHH!! I can't believe we have to wait til next week... #bachelorette
@TootlessWonderS that's not going to 'save the economy'
@FeedingBackTV ya‚Ä¶ I guess that's a bit true. Check my review on @TheReviewWeekly up by tomorrow evening!
Definitely disliking Ben! #bachelorette #bachelornation #livetweeting
Loved Des getting Brydon to kiss her at the end of their date! #bachelorette #livetweeting
@TootlessWonderS maybe you should learn to spell and use better grammar.
Although I'm not a it Brydon fan, the road trip date is really cute. #bachelorette #livetweeting
@TootlessWonderS @smallenfreuden I don't use cash anyway‚Ä¶ it's just a choice between debit or credit
I love that everyone is coming to Mikey about their dislike of Ben. I mean, I definitely don't like him either. #bachelorette #livetweeting
@TootlessWonderS @smallenfreuden minimum use is twice a day? Are you kidding? Minimum/normal use is probably 2-3 times a week.
Absolutely love Zak W and the antique journal he gave Des! Super cute! #bachelorette #livetweeting #AbMan
@TootlessWonderS @smallenfreuden ‚Ä¶why twice a day?
Awe poor Brandon! #bachelorette #livetweeting
Brooks &amp; Des doing some cute (but bad) dancing and singing? Love it! #bachelorette #livetweeting
@Alexis_Jordana I don't mind him. I think the bridal shop bit was great, he had a good reaction.
Ooh, first kiss of the #bachelorette season on the first one on one! I'm liking Des #livetweeting
Love that Brooks is having fun doing the tux/wedding dress shopping.
@TootlessWonderS @smallenfreuden most places with a fee tell you.
First one on one date, and it's with Brooks‚Ä¶ I'm warming on him! #bachelorette #livetweeting #bachelornation
In related news, is a $250 watch for dad too much for Father's Day? It looked REALLY nice!
I always go into Michael Hill Jewelers looking to buy a ring for myself and end up seeing things for others‚Ä¶
And suddenly I'm sluggish‚Ä¶ wish I didn't have to go grab more files.
@TootlessWonderS @smallenfreuden who said anything about late fees? It's called paying on time which I always do
When I was in grade 6 and he in grade 9‚Ä¶ that's when my crush started. No matter how much it dwindled, it's come back a little now.

Outfits like this always make me so pleased
You guys I'm so excited to see Mud tonight!
RT @jasonwhyte: Best movie ever, amirite? RT @FramedPanda: Tyrese just took his shirt off for no good reason. #2F2F
RT @RufusHound: I'm putting in an early shout for Chris O'Dowd for the new Doctor. #newdoctor
@celinajusta finally!
Fuuuuuck! I hate it when things don't work out :/ looks like I can't make it to Ramifications tonight, sorry @leg_stand!
@jasonwhyte yeah I realized that too.
@jasonwhyte ya poutine isn't my go to item so‚Ä¶
@leg_stand I think before might work better for me as well, I'll be near the theatre around 715/730 is that works?
@jasonwhyte they weren't.
@jasonwhyte I'm at the Van aquarium and discovered they had poutine on the menu. No time for you to get here :p
@jasonwhyte you jealous? http://t.co/tWIaKvZbys
@smallenfreuden once I get my card‚Ä¶probably yea.
Just read Love Game by @DanicaSheard. It's good, fun, and conflicting. Am I Team Avery or Team Dylan? I DON'T KNOW, HELP.
RT @HRCtweets: #FF @itentertainsme @Nekouyoku @reviewsbylauren @heartsways @writerTQB @geekgrrl33 @CareyGrace @Elodiep3_0 @evanmorgan808 @t‚Ä¶
So initially I hated Lana Del Ray and now I'm really a fan. Good stuff.
@RoommateKait @ZerbinMusic how could you not be?
Why are all the stations either playing commercials or CRAP right now? I want to sing and dance tonight, I'm super happy for no reason.
Anyone in Vancouver want to go see a play with me? I have a plus one‚Ä¶ :)
@jordyn_croft if only I knew what?
I can't help but think this summer is going to KICK ASS.
@leg_stand possible chat tomorrow to be posted on HRC, would right before or after show work best? We can email to figure it out if easier?
RT @HRCtweets: Gena Perala‚Äôs ‚ÄòExactly Nowhere‚Äô CD Is Announced + Review http://t.co/n5FxpOXbwZ via @hrctweets @reviewsbylauren
Watching One Tree Hill season four. Remember how awesome this show was? Fucking Derek on prom night though‚Ä¶
@jasonwhyte eh, I wouldn't be surprised if it were a few dollars extra.
@jasonwhyte you mean if the company supplied the banana?
@jasonwhyte seriously that was ridiculous. And it was still $5
Love that I wasn't invited to leave the house with mum today while they're doing work in the kitchen‚Ä¶ Now it's just loud and not relaxing :/
@jasonwhyte when do I get my cookies!
@jasonwhyte hahaha
After two very conflicting reviews of After Earth I don't know what to think.
@jasonwhyte can I have a cookie? :)
@jasonwhyte oh come on!
@jasonwhyte can you refollow me so I get a cookie?
@redcarpetcrash @transformers @ParamountPics I'm really not a fan‚Ä¶
I just don't know how I feel about the @PercyMovies. They changed so much from the 1st how will they get it back on track? But @LoganLerman!
@writerTQB @geekgrrl33 well it makes sense as they're the creators/admins, that's probably why
I'm playing this Sir Benfro thing‚Ä¶ and I've never done such a whimsical 'game' ever. Music &amp; art, perfection! Can I just watch it?
@writerTQB @geekgrrl33 ahhhh, so I'm not missing anything! I'd got that far as well but wasn't sure if I was missing a final step to make it
@megan2146 PS, when you start you'll be writing for @TheReviewWeekly &amp; that's where links will go up if you want to link on here!
@geekgrrl33 exactly! I want one in my Bachelorette season premiere review for which guys people have as favourites
@geekgrrl33 well I figure now when someone explains how to add a poll I'll see it as well! Certain reviews could use a poll at the end!
@geekgrrl33 @HRCtweets nope, I really want to be able to put polls in some of my posts though!
So... she really isn't that exciting. I wish I could get something much better and more exciting to dooooo!
@itentertainsme must be! I just don't understand how that comment makes people think HE HATES AMERICA!!!! like, do you not understand words?
Contemplating starting another book tonight but I already have a bunch of books started...and then I'll be up late finishing it.
@smallenfreuden FINALLY there are ads describing it‚Ä¶ so curious a few weeks ago with random ads asking if I #smallenfreuden.
Just asked who won the Pittsburg/Boston game‚Ä¶ clearly I'm losing track of hockey time since the Canucks were chucked first series.
@The_Hillary @HRCtweets @BloodyAmer1can @GirlCalledRach I'm so jealous of you guys!
Going to Ramifications of a Potential Crash on Friday! Potentially chatting with @leg_stand before (or after?) the show! Got any questions?
WHO WANTS TO FLY ME TO LA FOR THE TEEN CHOICE AWARDS &amp; LET ME INTERVIEW @iansomerhalder? Don't know about you but I think it's a great plan!
@jasonwhyte you walk away and judge them forever.
RT @jasonwhyte: Exactly. RT @scottEweinberg: You people could just watch the credits, you know. It's not a punishment. There's usually musi‚Ä¶
@jasonwhyte oh yeah? Haha, why thank you.
@itentertainsme @EW WTF clearly not a comment about 'America' as these "patriotic" people thought but a generalization about hating the vote
Listening to Anderson Cooper talk about how he's one of the oldest Madonna groupies. Aweeeeee!
Is it weird that my water smells of feet?
Loving that I can't do anything until the vault gets opened. I guess I'll just wait here‚Ä¶
This last day is going to be a disaster.
It's probably very thinly veiled anger but I don't care.
The problem with reading is it's really hard for me to put the book down even when it's midnight. Good thing it's the last 530 wakeful tom!

Brandon was definitely more interesting when he was somber. #bachelorette
Love that Mike realizes he would be more attractive with the British accent #bachelorette
Don't even know what this cute guys name is, but he's basically another @jefholm #bachelorette
Maybe Zach has problems meeting the right girl because he's alone in his massive property, naked with wildlife? #bachelorette
I like Drew already! #bachelorette
So Braydon or whatever his name is really isn't cute... but his dog is! #bachelorette
Surprise twist, @ChrisBHarrison gets a rose from @DesHartsock. @BacheloretteABC #bachelorette #livetweeting

WOAH, @DesHartsock's pad is AMAZING. #bachelorette #livetweet
So excited to see @DesHartsock as the #bachelorette!
Watching the beginning of #Bachelorette with the East Coast but that'll probably be cut short, so expect some #livetweeting in both PST&amp;EST
@celinajusta aw no, what happened?
About 75 files I can't find from A-C in mutuals. That's more than 3x as many empty files than ALL of the personal loans :/ fuuuuuuuuck

So happy it's 11am already, but REALLY wishing it was later so I could go home and nap before #Bachelorette tonight!

I don't know why I decided that putting myself in a depressed mood was a good idea‚Ä¶ do I need some teenage @taylorswift13 time?
&gt; him? Because I know I was and looking at these photos makes me think of it (and the pain) all over again. Ah, high school memories :/
105 photo album solely of random photos of me &amp; him we took together? Was it as painfully obvious to everyone else that I was in love with &gt;
1030pm? Should definitely already be sleeping in prep for another week of 530am wake ups‚Ä¶ on the other hand, old photos are more fun.
@celinajusta you mean, I was really cool? :P

@geekgrrl33 yes but they keep pushing that farther into the future because he dies, so each film is before that?
@geekgrrl33 @RealPaulWalker its because the movies keep getting better. Well, Tokyo Drift is the worst because no Diesel or Walker but still
To be honest I'm just really excited to see @RealPaulWalker grace my screen again. Looking forward to #Fast6 on Sunday!
Interview tidbit: @DerekGust wants to know what @HilaryDuff is up too (ps. she lives nearby).

Just realized I forgot my "later food" at the restaurant last Friday. What was I thinking? That sandwich was good :(
Interview tidbit: @DerekGust and I had the same sandwich and it was ALL MY IDEA (no, it really wasn't, I'm such a copycat but it was goood)
Interview tidbit: @DerekGust thinks Justin Bieber has good hair.

@jordyn_croft after 5pm and starting by 8! Choose a time I can put into my calendar.

@jordyn_croft you want to come? :)

@celinajusta ouch!
@celinajusta what did you do?
@geekgrrl33 thanks!
@geekgrrl33 that's good! It's Victoria Day in Canada so no working today. 5:30 wake up for the next few weeks though. :(
@celinajusta nice!
@jordyn_croft oh you got it! Have fun :)
@geekgrrl33 luck!
@BC_ru I guess I won't turn twenty then. Having a job where I need to wake up at 5:30 for the next few weeks means I need routine &amp; early.
@jasonwhyte I know I should, it's just there's always other things too.
If I didn't have a need to take out contacts before sleep I would have gone to sleep in my clothes. Eurovision is not worth staying up til 1
I hate when dad uses my bathroom when I'm living in their house. I always feel like he'll snoop and discover condoms or something.
@jasonwhyte never actually seen Donnie Darko‚Ä¶ I just love that song
Mad World by Gary Jules is one of my favourite songs.

Semifinal of #eurovision2013 right now!
Quick dinner with the parents after the movie before the Eurovision final. #familynight
So‚Ä¶ I absolutely LOVED Star Trek.
Even mum said she's excited for Star Trek tomorrow. It's only a big deal once you realize she doesn't care about anything I'm excited about.
@geekgrrl33 yeah, unfortunately it didn't work. There's always next time! Now for some sleep‚Ä¶ can't believe I'm tired so early!
And now @JohnMCochran is finished without answering me. I guess there's always next time! How unfortunate though!
@geekgrrl33 haha! No worry, I've pretty much lost hope but until @JohnMCochran stops answering questions I probably won't stop asking for it
@JohnMCochran says to never lose hope, but it seems a bit dire at the moment. Definitely doubting he'll see this and give me an interview.
@JohnMCochran How old we're you when Survivor started and where did the love of the show originate? PS please can I interview you?
@geekgrrl33 clearly it isn't going very well!
Just waiting (patiently, I hope) for @JohnMCochran to say he'll do an interview with me so I can go to sleep happy. Please?
@JohnMCochran I've always wanted to go on Amazing Race‚Ä¶ :)
@JohnMCochran did Jeff's commentary during challenges ever get annoying?
@JohnMCochran what has been the biggest change since coming back from your first season of Survivor?
@JohnMCochran how did your expectations of Survivor change from when you were a fan to the reality as a player?
@JohnMCochran what do you look for in a girl? PS can I interview you?
@JohnMCochran how did your game plan change this season from beginning to end? PS: can I interview you?
@d3571nyr053 @JohnMCochran @alex1231D well he was my favourite since day one of South Pacific so‚Ä¶
@JohnMCochran what was your favourite moment of the survivor experience, other than winning? Also, will you do an interview for my site?
@JohnMCochran @alex1231D awe,but he doesn't need it!
I just want @JohnMCochran to respond and tell me he'll give me the interview. Then I'll be a happy clam for the evening.
@geekgrrl33 thanks.
@JohnMCochran how did you handle being away from your twitter followers for the duration of the show?
@JohnMCochran would you mind doing an interview with me for my site?
New photo‚Ä¶ taken from the iPad, so much clearer than the iPhone but it shows more flaws:/
@geekgrrl33 that's good
@geekgrrl33 oh I've heard of that movie! Didn't realize it was such a b movie, haha
@geekgrrl33 maybe!
@geekgrrl33 what the hell did I just watch?
@geekgrrl33 well she's Russian, so maybe they thought it was suitable? There were a lot of bad looks, that was just the worst.
The questions that get answered by @JohnMCochran when I have a bunch of questions and would really just love an interview for my site‚Ä¶
@geekgrrl33 I hate that kind of job though! My filing job now is bad enough, I'm just happy I get paid well!
@JohnMCochran could I get an interview soon?
@geekgrrl33 I don't understand why she did it! Absolutely no need!
@geekgrrl33 it's a good idea! I'm just still in uni so grocery/store/restaurant jobs are what I need during that.
@JohnMCochran how do I get an interview with you? Or a date? Either one really‚Ä¶ preferably the latter.
@geekgrrl33 I have no clue! It's horrible,horrible,horrible. Did I mention horrible? That was a shocking photo from Cannes.
@geekgrrl33 I never actually got to watching a movie, I'll probably start one soon‚Ä¶ I was helping my dad in the garden
@geekgrrl33 oh for sure, ill need to create two resumes soon‚Ä¶ I need one for the whole writing thing plus a general one for jobs during uni.
@jordyn_croft I love you for trying &lt;3
I can't get over how AWFUL this is! http://t.co/KiP09w1gYP #IMDb
@jordyn_croft nice! If it doesn't work with you I'm always available for some Aussie company. Haha! Or just ask if he has a brother :P #ohfl
@jordyn_croft that sounds like perfection, was it a good meeting?
@geekgrrl33 I have the pizza bit down‚Ä¶ don't need to do any resume writing, but I will have movies!

@jasonwhyte well, can't change the tickets now so I'm seeing it in 3D with the parents on Sunday.
Interviewing @DerekGust today at lunch! Last chance to send me questions for him is by 1PST!
You know what I came home to? Trimming my mums toenails. WHY?
‚Äú@redcarpetcrash: Christopher Nolan Approached To Direct The Next James Bond Movie http://t.co/29o3o1FlXe #movies‚Äù isn't that interesting‚Ä¶
@BC_ru that really doesn't sound very fun‚Ä¶
@jasonwhyte why not 3D? Just asking because I saw same trailer in 2D &amp; 3D and it looked so much better in 3D, &amp; parents bought 3D tickets.
Finally back home!
An hour after we're supposed to depart and we're finally boarding.

@jasonwhyte when was the film made?
People that only like @JohnMCochran since he won the million in Survivor are insane. How did you not Immediately love him in South Pacific??
I love that @jasonwhyte is so caught up on the politics of smoking in Star Trek

@ZerbinMusic true true! &amp; if you'd made it Friday night instead‚Ä¶ Definitely let me know next time and I'll be there instead of in Calgary!
For some reason I'm feeling very nostalgic right now as I listen to @ZerbinMusic, whyyy?
@ChickenMclovin you enjoy semen do you?
RT @geekgrrl33: I'm so glad neither Sam or Dean died this season. That was getting to be a bit redundant. #Supernatural
I must live in a constant state of shock.
Sometimes I still get surprised that it is really 2013. I'll only stop being surprised when its 2014 and I'm surprised about that. ‚Ä¶&gt;
Just learned bananas are high in iron. Normally I'm low in iron, so lets bring on the bananas!
So‚Ä¶ other than writing some reviews, what am I doing tonight? I could be hanging out with @ZerbinMusic and @DerekGust but noo I'm in Calgary
RT @jasonwhyte: #DontWifeHerIf she talks/texts during movies.
@ChickenMclovin unfortunately that would have made it worse.
I've become exhausted. Should I start on the next shelf of the commercials? Already finished 3.5 shelves in 2 hours. http://t.co/xDMWpxaP47
@ChickenMclovin but easy isn't in sleazy‚Ä¶
@jordyn_croft well then WHY wasn't I on your (our) sushi date?
Just read a #StarTrek article about how this film ends leaving it open for more films. Obviously, but spoiler, but EXCITING.
@jordyn_croft so I'm your sister right? :P
@Dani_DesChamps Ruby Sparks ended up being really good! Definitively check it out if you have Netflix :) my review should be up tonight!
@DerekGust wait, tonight? Either way, probably can't make it :( lunch + interview in Vancouver this weekend instead?
First guy riding a bike on the road that I've seen in all Calgary. How disgusting that it's rare.
People that actually move away from me when they want to smoke are my favourite kind of smokers. So much more considerate.
Remember when @mradamscott was on Boy Meets World? Good times.
Still happy for @JohnMCochran Can't believe it was a unanimous win! That can't happen very often? He could probably provide the stats‚Ä¶
RT @JohnMCochran: In all sincerity, last night was the greatest night of my life. I deeply appreciate all the kind messages you've been sen‚Ä¶

@Dani_DesChamps I've decided to go with Ruby Sparks, perhaps. That might change. I'm so uninspired with Netflix lately!
@Dani_DesChamps that's part of the problem, I have no clue!
RT @celinajusta: God has a sense of humour... Look at ostriches!

Seriously what the hell is this #smallenfreuden thing? I come to Calgary and its all over the place, never heard of it until Calgary‚Ä¶
What kind of country do you live in where bringing the nation's flag to the game for the anthem is common? Fascist countries... I mean what?
Seriously, this guy is singing the weirdest version of the Canadian anthem...#Bruins #game7 #playoffs
Because maybe he chose M&amp;M because of M&amp;Ms and not his real name and someone spelled it the wrong way so he made up a story so it for better
Or‚Ä¶ like maybe when you walk into his house there are bowls of M&amp;Ms all over the place.
Do you think Eminem ever ironically buys M&amp;Ms from a store? Like‚Ä¶ to see the reaction from the cashier?
‚Ä¶so Boston needs to win this playoff series because of the Marathon Bombings? Why must these things be related??
So 24 stops for a while as Kiefer does Touch. Touch is canceled and now Fox announces 24 will return? Come on! Let it go!
Watching the Boston/Toronto game tonight!
@TopdeckTravel ha! Maybe I will!
Just gave myself an electric shock at work. FUCK. Although I can't blame construction I'd really like to.
Why am I still in bed?
@JohnMCochran nah, you just need to figure out what you want to pursue and work towards that! What kind of writing are you interested in?
@TopdeckTravel I just want to do EVERYTHING, which is a bit unfortunate.
Watching Krem2News on CBS &amp; so shocked. Weather segment included Celsius temperatures for Canadian cities mentioned. Don't see that often!
I have to say, I'm excited for @Survivor_Tweet to begin again in September. But Blood vs Water? What the hell does that mean?
That is so close! So happy that @MalcolmWHW won the Sprint Favourite Player award!
I'm so happy @ReynoldToepfer has got rid of the stache.
@JeffProbst just described me... sitting with a bag of Doritos yelling at the TV. But I'm also tweeting to him. Oh good.
So...how do I casually tweet about @JohnMCochran so he'll actually see it and want to speak with me? I've been loyal since his first season!
He's making jokes, oh I love him. Can I please meet him and befriend him and just hang out with him? @JohnMCochran #survivorfinale
Literally jumping up and down about how excited I am for @JohnMCochran to win @Survivor_Tweet

Love that @JohnMCochran is in the final three! #survivorfinale @Survivor_Tweet

@itentertainsme Gosling is later, Wahlberg tonight! I will, thanks!
@BC_ru I know. I rarely tip anyway. At least no one thought I was engaged!
General rule: if it isn't the same person who took my order that brings my food you don't get a tip. You're just looking at your phone!
"Can I also get a darker water?" ‚Ä¶what the fuck did you just ask for from the waitress??
I have my @TopdeckTravel Europe brochure! Excited to plan out a possible 2014 trip now! @TopdeckEurope
@itentertainsme called mum to help me decide, she wants to see Gosling too so I'm doing that when I go home :) Pain&amp;Gain is Mark Wahlberg
There's this twelve year old with an eyebrow piercing. You're allowed that so young? He's probably actually sixteen but he looks SO young!
Ugh, humidity.
@itentertainsme I'm just not sure if I want sort of silly (P&amp;G) or dramatic Gosling (PBtP)
@itentertainsme I don't know, I saw Gatsby on Wednesday and Iron Man last weekend. Between Place Beyond the Pines and Pain &amp; Gain. &gt;&gt;
New plan‚Ä¶ going out to see a movie tonight!
@geekgrrl33 or maybe it's Aldergrove...
@geekgrrl33 it's filmed near where I live, Abbotsford, BC!
@geekgrrl33 very nice! Is that a good show?
@geekgrrl33 yeah, I'll do something exciting tomorrow.
@geekgrrl33 yeah, so maybe for now I'll just have a relaxing day in the hotel. There's nothing near my hotel so it feels like a hassle to go
@geekgrrl33 like... I've been told there is Chinatown that isn't as good as Vancouver's, a tropical garden inside a mall, &amp; that's it.
@geekgrrl33 I was here last weekend as well. Hit the zoo and I've ventured a little bit into downtown but everyone says there's nothing much
@geekgrrl33 I'm in Calgary for work.
Am I really going to just sit in the hotel room all day watching movies? FG goes until 3PM and then what the hell am I going to do?
I've been watching How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days right now... Fools Gold is on next... I LOVE McConnaughey + Hudson together.
Definitely chucking a few things I brought with me to Calgary. I'd rather just buy new boots and Keds once home.
It's the time of night where I'm googling actors &amp; discovering things they're in &amp; going on to new ones... @paddywarbucks was in Scream 3!?!
