Watching the prayer vigil.  Why are all the government folks on the stage instead of the victims families?
If Obama's tax increase goes through, the annual amount confiscated in a year represents 8.6 days of government spending.  Politics.
@MittRomney @barackobama my entire family are independent business owners.  The government didn't do it.
@buffaloon @mittromney @barackobama the government never created money only misappropriated other people's money
Obama said, "If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen."
that is a slap in the face to all Americans

Guilty guilty guilty! Sandusky will pay for what he did!
Aspen mountain is beautiful.  Hiking with husband and loving life
@MittRomney The issue isn't the number of public employees it's their benefits and pensions that are too rich.
Pursuit of happiness doesn't guarantee happiness.  Risk and reward - both must be at play for the system to work.
A moral hazard is when benefits of every individual's sacrifice and labor belong to the government, not the individual.
Fundamental - sounds so good!
I hate American Home 
Shield.  I have paid them for 10 years - more than $5000.  They can't fix my pool pump.  Guess what?  Self insured!
Performers follow convention.  High performers break from it.

@imarkhanlon Conda just managed to eliminate two of the biggest competitors to guarantee she will have a spot in the finals.  She is wicked
