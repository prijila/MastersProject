@A_rosa_jd This song is a song that was released about 7/8 years ago (more now) by an artist named Kate Bush.She is the bomb - truly... xxx
@ZionistWolf Tbh it wasnt my cup of tea. Sopranos gets better n better n some more better!
@ZionistWolf No Comment on The Shield. Sopranos if you havent watched already is another Top programme. Easy to follow and quite fast
@ZionistWolf Awww bless him #SimpleSteve (joke). Will check out your recommendations.Stick with The Wire + Breaking Bad #YouWillThankMe
@ZionistWolf Is that with David Duchoveny? Heard its good if its the same one.
@ZionistWolf Steven is one dumb brother - literally, but he is accurate in his examination of The Wire.One to watch #BucketList
@ZionistWolf Will check them out bro! on your recommendation.
@ZionistWolf The Wire is better than any movie other programme or soap - in my opinion.Its just very slow and requires patience.
@ZionistWolf Each season concentrates on a different part of drug life.s1-the streets,s2-the docks s3-police,s4 -new breed s5-hierachy etc
@ZionistWolf The Wire is one of those programmes which doesnt give you much - nothing obvious - no cliffhangers. My favourite of all time
@ZionistWolf Never watched Newsroom.. The Wire by a country mile is the best programme ever.Its very slow but the character building is üëç
@ZionistWolf I will give West Wing a go! I thought the same about Breaking Bad but stuck with it..It gets better! Sopranos is ace + The Wire
@ZionistWolf I highly recommend Breaking Bad its clever.Forget Dexter.Season 5 of breaking bad there is a break (now) its a real cliffhanger
@ZionistWolf Yeah he got game is a decent movie.You ever watched About Schmidt? Subtle, not big budget but my type of film.
@ZionistWolf Haha they both directed by Affleck.. (correct me if I am wrong). I watched a cheesy film called The Rebound - I really enjoyed!
Out of the 2 movies I watched today (Django unchained and Avenger Assemble) I preffered the latter.Django had too much going on but was ok
@ZionistWolf I know mate it was too much after a bit - kind of spoilt the movie.Inglorious is well better!You watched anything üÜí on Netflix?
@ZionistWolf Listen its Tarantino.Its a MEGA cast its a decent watch but nothing special.Didnt enjoy the continuos use of the N word either!
@ZionistWolf Waltz was the best but deteriorated over the course.It was no Pulp Fiction or Good Bad or Ugly.Think its been overhyped tbh.
@ZionistWolf Agree totally. Scenes that were good were amazing hence the 8/10 however there was too many silly moments.
Django Unchained gets an 8/10 from me.Worth a watch but very predictable.
Just watched Avengers Assemble, Wow what effects - Impressive #ActionPacked
@FootballFunnys Haha thats crazy - it serves his right!
