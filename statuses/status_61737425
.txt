RT @piersmorgan: ENOUGH.
#WengerOUT.
@Pochayiddo @HotspurSam has he actually predicted anything other than a loss? How much @SkySports paying him to be a pundit? Absolute mug.
Lloris catches them. Poor keeping that from Vorm
@spursnewsonly I think Kane also needs to stop being greedy. He could have slipped an easy ball to Lamela. Team game, not Kane FC
Credit to Lamela there for not giving that ball up.
Get in my Son #HereComesTheSon
It was always going to be difficult or Kane to replicate his form from last season. He now needs to step up a gear and change his approach
Kane's greed at that angle prevents us being 1-0 up there. He could have laid that off for Lamela to tap in
We need a striker #HereComesTheSon
Well in my Son #COYS
@S1mmo74 still working! http://t.co/7pzGck7J0g
The best bit about this game so far was the nap I had from 46-62 min.
Realistically, how long has Poch got given Levy's history? I say 4-5 games.
Says it all when we are struggling against a team who many have tipped to go down.
I'd take Chadli off at HT and let Andros run at them. There's not enough of that happening right now.
Our style of play is enough to make me nod off. This is like AVB all over again.
Sometimes, it would be easier to just admit defeat.
@RyanOnVacation Hi Ryan, when do the tickets for Leeds go on sale for the gig in March. Thanks buddy.
@SkyNews so do the millions of British homeless people.
Spin spin spin spin spin @Xercise4Less
@Cmonuspurs1 I agree with that 100%. If we are paying the guy we got to try and resolve the issues and use him in a position we're desperate

@spurs_ki the Levy way?
I wouldn't even play FIFA with one striker in my entire squad.
Thinking of getting a new shirt with the No. 9 on the back, will save money as no name going above it. Absolute joke of a club.
@FootballGogme @bunionboy2011 perfectly sums up Levy. The gun is now loaded and he won't think twice about pulling the trigger on Poch.
#LevyTimeToGo
@CallumHaymes couldn't agree more.
@leedsyid Perfectly summed up. Distances himself from the trouble by highlighting poor results. No manager stands a chance with us.
@SpursOfficial No Stubhub tweets? Seems a very appropriate time in which to deliver that topic.
@Coys1979 @HITCsport Ace?????
For whatever reason I get the feeling Poch and Levy are not on the same page. History repeating itself with Levy pulling the trigger again

THINK we should, will we though... I very much doubt it https://t.co/Gjm8IUL7O5

@CallumHaymes Surely we could tempt Rasiak or Andy Booth?
@hotspurnews1882 if we don't, we are one injury away from a total disaster.

Nice to see Lamela playing with a smile on he's face and as for the goal… wow! Always knew the lad had talent!
RT @InsideN17: We've got a manager that made Lallana a £25m player. Have a bit of faith we know what we're doing and have a long term plan.
@HotspurInsider That would mean finishing ahead of Everton. Not going to happen.
@HotspurSam @SpursShout You are probably right. Now, Where is Grzegorz Rasiak's number? Let's give him a bell
@CallumHaymes also, Adebayor will be off to the ACON in early 2015! They've dropped a bollock not getting someone in!
@Spurspanyol We
Need stability and Poch has strengthened a very weak area at the back but we are also weak up front which has been ignored
@AmericanSpurs this will not happen. Trust me. We are getting no striker.
@talktottenham2 me too. I was really hoping this was going to come off. The goons will be getting a good player.
@talktottenham2 the majority didn't want him, apparently he's not good enough yet I think he'll be massive hit at Arsenal. Pathetic fans
@CallumHaymes yes. I'd rather do this. I'm
All for Welbeck joining us permanent.
@Spurspanyol it's all looking a bit bleak.
@SkyBet so, loan deals do not count. Where is your 'no permanent move' market then?
@TalkingTHFC And I'd imagine @SkyBet have a market for that! Co-incidence?
My late evening will consist of: The Last of us on PS4, Twitter on the phone and @SkySportsNewsHQ on the ipad!
All those saying they hope we don't sign Welbeck will be the ones who call him the signing of the season. Let's give him a chance!
@HotspurInsider Most definately. It all boils down to money I'm afraid.

#TransferDeadlineDay https://t.co/UrjbSMK3Yw
Less than 15 hours to go in the Transfer Deadline Day sponsored by Sky Bet
Final dress rehearsal done. It's Sky Sports pantomime today. Plenty of 'Sky Sources Say' and then markets on Sky Bet.
@HotspurInsider I have that feeling this one will pass with very little happening on the way in for us but a few leaving.
@paulyid I think a couple will be added tomorrow, confident we might get Welbeck and although not most people's choice. I really rate him.
@paulyid I think he is, but it's all going to depend on the opposition. We needed a man with some pace today up there.
@Mishmoo5 @Ur_spurs_news I'd be quite happy with Welbeck.
RT @FootySuperTips: A draw is never a good result against teams fighting for relegation, Burnley will be very disappointed not to have won.
RT @SpursStatMan: Eric Dier is the first defender in Premier League history to score in his first two appearances.
I knew we'd get Besiktas!
@bunionboy2011 @TomCStandard @nad_THFC I like Bony, but I think Ade will have an equal season in this new system
@HotspurRelated @LyallThomas I hope this one comes off. He's versatile player, quick feet. Offers something we currently don't have.
RT @HotspurInsider: Who would you start at left back on Sunday?

Danny Rose (Retweet!)

Ben Davies (Favourite!)

#THFC
@WindyCOYS he's lazy and lacks enthusiasm. I'd move him on ASAP.
#mooseeuropaleague Spurs 4-0 Townsend first goal
@HotspurRelated I'd be quite happy with this. Be a great addition. Very versatile player.
@HotspurInsider I'm also thinking that spending £20m on a player when Bentaleb hasn't put a foot wrong would be very harsh on the lad
@Coys1979 I don't read anything into it other than he's more concerned about football matters ahead.
If LVG isn't shocked at #MUFC being beat by League 1 opponents is that almost suggesting they are potential relegation fodder?
And to think we could have got #LVG
RT @crackersTHFC: .@ManUtd you ok hun?
@SpursOfficial Top professional, I wish him well. #ThankYouDaws
@CallumHaymes @LyallThomas I'd hand Jan the captaincy if he signs a new deal. If not, Lloris would make a perfect choice.
@HotspurRelated 1) don't want Andros to leave 2) is Schneiderlind going to offer anymore than Bentaleb? Who , in my opinion has been awesome

@MoughtTHFC totally agree. I'd love to see Depay and Lamela run the Wings for us.
@officialMKcoys think he'd be a better fit for LW role. Chadli is more central attacking midfielder than a winger. Perfect deal if it's true
@talktottenham2 @AddictedtoSpurs I think if this deal happens then Chadli will be sold. It'll be a one in one out process.
@gloryglorytott @SpursInTheBlood @CallumHaymes we have to trust Poch to pick the best, which is why he's the gaffer and none of us are.

Let's just get one thing right, AVB didn't lose he's job because of one result. The football this season has been dire, it's been coming
RT @DemiCyp: Levy should never have sacked Harry #AVB #Tottenham
@StevieCurtis Stats aside, the football was dross.
Oh no, just seen Christian Gross buying a ticket for a train.
RT @TheSpursDrum: If you don't do your job properly you get the sack. It's the same in every walk of life.
@CharlieDolley I'm surprised he's still there. Get rid. We've gone backwards under him. I'll be glad when I get my spurs back
@nicktimms_ agreed. It's not about losing, it's the manner in which we are being beaten. We look like relegation fodder
@smiffy1612 @Gibocarrizan performances are bad, results are worse. The place needs a lift, he has to go.
@AddictedtoSpurs @TottenhamToday @LewisHoltby he's been our best player for last few weeks. I wish the rest of the squad had he's passion
@SkyFootball @spurs_family how much do you pay Jamie Redknapp to make that prediction.I'll quit my job and do it for 25% of what he's on
@leedsyid can't say I'm surprised at this. It's been coming.
@sijdcruze it's ok, Man City pay for most of them
@Wizward the backwards bit has already occurred,it happened last season, we went from 4th to 5th and we're sliding further down.He has to go
One for the statistics people. Has a manager ever lost their job at this stage of a season with as many points as Spurs have?
@Lord_Sugar @westham009 would be interesting to see just what Would happen to results if they did swap jobs!
@nicktimms_ lack of motivation, tactics not understood by players.Totally agree that once over the line etc,but It'll all come back to AVB
@TTID1882COYS AVB already taken us back
I look at it this way. The bad outweighs the good with AVB in charge. Can't think of one reason to stay but loads for him to go.
@HotspurRelated Hmmmmmmm. Why on earth would he be here?
@2010LeeHurst Castleford, just outside Leeds.
Dear Santa, please can Spurs have a new left back?

I honestly can't see us winning today. A bold prediction but AVB won't be our gaffer this time next week
@AddictedtoSpurs that has been the best bit in 43 mins
35 mins, I'm at the bored stage again. This is worse than the Ramos days.
@sijdcruze @Longy1982 it's looking that way.
“@Longy1982: @kirkyboy23 Look at what came today @danrogers77 http://t.co/B3RtM4vQNl”
@Longy1982 cheers mate. I think this will be AVB's last game!
@BroadcastMoose I think he has two league games to save he's job regardless of tonight's resujt
@CharlieDolley finally. Someone who is actually backing the club and not the man. The football is dross. I can't watch it.
@CharlieDolley I think Laudrup would be a decent choice. AVB is on the brink. 2 league games to save he's job IMO
@6nill I probably sound negative, look at the stats. 9 goals. 26 games left. Top 4 is way of out reach. Have to score to win games. Simples!
@6nill But what if the ice breaks? Because it sure looks that way right now

@foreverTHFC @Wizward I don't have that answer. But how long will people put up with it? Are we prepared to finish bottom 6? Where next?
@foreverTHFC @Wizward I can give you plenty of reasons for AVB to go.Starting with the shocking results, the lack of goals, boring football
@foreverTHFC @Wizward I'm wondering how long AVB has left. I can see us getting nothing from next two games.
@foreverTHFC @Wizward we haven't got going at all this season. It's worrying.
@Woodsy921 exactly how it is.I've said for weeks, 9 points came came from 3 penalties,3 penalties from 9 goals this season! AVB can't fix it
@bunionboy2011 good and a very tough question. As it stands, we have huge problems. We need someone who has a plan B
@bunionboy2011 he's had he's time as far as I'm concerned. We've been embarrassing since the first game.
@talktottenham2 @TrendsUK it's not just today though is it? Newcastle, West Ham? Hull at home? Sorry, AVB's had he's time
@ChrisDoughty32 @BroadcastMoose agreed. He gone by tonight.
@phillipsdj I think I'll join the #AVBout campaign!
@MyerSteiner @TalkingTHFC it's been poor all season. The 20 points we have flatters us. We should be where palace are. Simple.
@MyerSteiner @TalkingTHFC AVB picks the team, selects the tactics and trains them all week. It's just not working.
@TalkingTHFC top 4! Be lucky to see top 14
@phillipsdj I don't think AVB is the man to find that combination. He looks lost
@phillipsdj hasn't it been like that all season?
@PeteDomican @crackersTHFC Boring to watch, problems not recent, been all season. How long AVB got left?
@MightyTottenham he'll be gone by Christmas.

@Wizward that tweet could have been shortened to the first two words
@bigyidnigelbeck not a prayer  Newcastle will nick another. Pressure on AVB
@talktottenham2 he's also had a full season. This I absolutely dire. Those that say 'keep the faith' are just kidding themselves.
@Andy_1882 @talktottenham2 shows how missing Sig is doesn't it!
Let's see those 'keep the faith' once we lose again today. I'm bored watching this.
