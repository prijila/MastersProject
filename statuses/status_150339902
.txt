@EMTrains I have now sent my email address.
@EMTrains I can but I think you need to follow me before I can DM my email address to you.
@EMTrains Emailed my delay repay form on the 23rd and haven't heard anything. Could you look into this please. Was sent by "Alex Eales"
@EMTrains thanks for this.
@EMTrains Hi there. How long does a delay repay request usually take?
@EMTrains cheers let's hope the 11.26 is on time....
@EMTrains will have to get the 11.26 train if we are lucky and that one isn't also cancelled. A pretty bad bay for East Midlands Trains.
@EMTrains 10.16 train from Corby to London was cancelled. Replacement bus broke down. Second replacement was told to wait a further 20mins.

Drat everton getting battered. West Brom have been great this season.
Well done Norwich. Well deserved equaliser
@Bloodzeed cracker! Spurs have to play 4-4-2 it is clear
@Jook My best transfer so far is Granero to QPR

@P4tch4riyaholic lol if only
@P4tch4riyaholic Im glad for DDG. Goal keeper is so important to win titles. Remember the last team to win one with a bad keeper?
@P4tch4riyaholic @guardian They will destroy Liverpool anyway I would imagine.
@P4tch4riyaholic @manutd_mark I guess that money bought RVP instead.
@walemutu hmm I'm not ire it was a good purchase but I'm excited to find out.
@P4tch4riyaholic he was the best player for united. Cleverley was also very good. De Gea looks amazing in goal. X
@P4tch4riyaholic we weren't bad at all really. Everton were incredible. If they played like that every week they would be in the top 4. X
@Bloodzeed What's your score for tonight? I'm going 3-1 united. Kagawa, Rooney and RVP scoring. Jellavic for Everton.
@P4tch4riyaholic Oh yes my dear! Who would you play tonight? xx
@Jook ah right I don't thank you. Lol

@P4tch4riyaholic done. Time your visit correctly and we can see a united game
@P4tch4riyaholic come to England and I'll gladly let you cook for me. Sounds fab.
@P4tch4riyaholic ah right. I suppose you could do vegetarian food. Unlikely to poison people that way :)
@P4tch4riyaholic really? Why?
@P4tch4riyaholic yeah I agree. I'm surprised he didn't move last season.
@P4tch4riyaholic bless. Just cook with beef. Pretty hard to poison people with that. So what's getting you down?
@louisegeeee OMG wow! Best chain restaurant ever.
@katyperry yes!
@Linnane90 that would be nice. Noone is defending in that formation lol.
@P4tch4riyaholic ouch. Have you poisoned anyone
@P4tch4riyaholic problem is he is on 100k a week or more. I want him to go to someone in the pl so that's get to see him play.
@P4tch4riyaholic you must love cooking :)
@Linnane90 good. We have too many midfielders I don't know whose going to be in the starting 11. Probably Scholes and giggs lol
@P4tch4riyaholic kagawa looked great aswell. Very positive!
@P4tch4riyaholic Jesus Aom how much money do you have?
@P4tch4riyaholic yep. Powell looked amazing in today pre season friendly btw. Quality all the way
@akudemeka true. I'm not sure Walcott will stay either
@Teems101 powell looked amazing in the pre season game today. Cannot wait for the new season
@Sc00by87 I'm hoping that wenger tries to buy llorente
@albertlin I think he's on the way it if I'm honest. Might just play in the big games this season.
@NealLucasRec @brushgently  lol though I don't want to displace welbeck  and chic. Powell looked amazing I. Today's preseason game
@Crippy4Villa agreed he's my favourite united player. Powell looked awesome in the pre season today.
@Linnane90 I agree but where would we play him? I thought he was a right winger
RT @Jay_in_Essex: Hit me Bebe one more time.
RT @R_o_M: Six foot two, eyes aren't blue, Bébé sells the Big Issue, with a knick knack paddy wack give a dog a bone, now he can afford  ...
@Mike83230483 shame.
@balogunog 1st would be a huge ask I think. With Hulk you would have a real chance. Otherwise I'm not sure the strikers will do the job.
@Linnane90 @bbcsport I really doubt Moura will happen but can only be good. I still like Welb. Him Roo and Kagawa looks a good combination.
@balogunog I think they will end up third and have a good run in the CL again. The EPL is just so hard to win these days.
@Teems101 do you know when the game starts?
@akinbolu Its a shame but it looks like Hulk isn't happening. I'd love to see him in the EPL
@AmatchaDan It is a certainty.
@Mike83230483 I like Joe Allen. Is he English? Could play for England now you never know.
@chrismurphy1991 Could happen you never know. City still have Adebayour to deal with.
@McPipHunter Yep Agreed. I can only hope Arsenal continue to at least finish in the top 4 for your own sake.
@Linnane90 @bbcsport Where do you think he will be played? I literally have no idea who will start for united in the coming season
@McPipHunter Yeah its a real shame. If Arsenal had kept all their players they would deffo have won something by now.
@balogunog He's special because he commands the respect of everyone at the club. That's the most important think. Like SAF at united.
@moojor Agreed. He will go back to Russia. I want Carroll at West ham next year though. Could be a big hit.
@ciro30 @jamesking167 haha. Burned!
@Fair_knight Yes
@Legzit I'm still gutted about Hargreaves to this day. What a player he was in his prime. #bbcsportsday
@akudemeka I don't believe Arsenal can hope for any more than 17m tbh. They aren't in a good position.
@McPipHunter I think Arsenal will get 17m max. A replacement will be needed also. unless Walcott gets a chance up front.
@CptCrazy2011 Agreed. No need for him. #bbcsportsday
@balogunog Hopefully Hazard will do well. If not he would be a tremendous waste of money. He really needs to replace Lampard. Tough ask.
RT @GbengaHacket: Arsenal should exchange Rvp wit
berba nice deal #bbcsportsday
@akudemeka Chamakh? Lol. I think Arsenal should break the bank and try and get Higuain from Madrid
@David_Jay24 @BBCSportsday Problem is I just can't see the transfer fee being reinvested.
@Frankcom_21 I can see Arsenal selling him to city but surely not Spurs. It would be great though. #bbcsportsday
@James_Ofori Are we any more of a rival than city? Juve will get him. Bonkers that they can't get a contract extension in the first place.
RT @inam251: #bbcsportsday 30 million for a 29year old doesn't make sense add to the fact he's only got a years contract
@moojor What about Chamakh? Enormous waste of money. I hope you guys get Carroll btw. Cracking player who deserves to play.
@markcarney17 its just bonkers hes worth 17m max.
@chrismurphy1991 I have no idea why City want him. They have 3 better strikers.
@imdavidhaughton I'm sure your right. though I bet they know that and are offering pittance.
@balogunog LOL quality. They have a great manager and should be entertaining to watch nonetheless.
@ChiefWaffler I can't see Toress back to his best ever again but he can still finish with the best of them. Played well at the Euros
@brushgently @NealLucasRec He could go to Chelsea or Juve. Juve is my bet.
@Linnane90 @bbcsport Its exciting to have some fresh English talent at the top of the EPL
@AngryDots Probs right. Spurs have a better side than Arse but they always nick it in the end. Poor old Liverpool have nowhere to go.
@imdavidhaughton Yep. Sadly I think he will go to Italy. Shame cos that's more quality gone from the EPL.
@robspitzy Lol. United could play with a 3-3-4 combination with Welb, Chic, Roon and RVP up front
@ChiefWaffler Agreed though his form may suffer. Rooneys like that. Maybe RVP should move to Chelsea. He would play every week there.
@balogunog I can see liverpool finishing 5th or 6th this year and building for the future.
@turza Or Spurs. AVB loves him. Torres looks decent again now so hopefully that will work out for Chelsea. It can only improve the EPL.
@tapmantwo I think he will go abroad tbh. Shame because he adds something to the premier league.
@ChiefWaffler Agreed. I don't care about Nasri but Fab was very good. I like Podolski though so maybe that will work out
@Eriatha Agreed. Rafael seems to be inadequate. Loads of potential though.
@balogunog @chelseafc great point
@AngryDots Absolutely right. Gotta give them that. Whose in your top 4 this year? #bbcsportsday
RT @MarcD2909: RVP isn't worth what's being touted. 1 year left, 1 good season, nearly 29. Be realistic. #bbcsportsday
RT @MISTERDEEIAM: #bbcsportsday everyone knows what Arsenal need to do but they wont invest, they will take the RVP cash and plod along  ...
@Amanuel45 This would be sensible #bbcsportsday
@fredasquith Great logic here. This is where my money is #bbcsportsday
@ChiefWaffler on last year I agree but do you think either player will be satisfied by being a squad player. Balotelli looks awesome also.
@ChiefWaffler But do they really need him? Would he pay every week there? I'm not so sure #bbcsportsday
@albertlin Agreed. Evra needs replacing. #bbcsportsday
@walemutu Do you think MCFC need RVP? I think he may end up a Juve. #bbcsportsday
@albertlin Problem is that united have loads of players capably of playing centre mid. There just not world class at it.
@nduokonkwo Not so sure. Nasri has his best years ahead of him.
@turza If I were chelsea I'd get rid of Sturridge and focus on Lukaku. Basically Drogba mark two. #bbcsportsday
@balogunog shows how far they have fallen. At least they have an awesome manager now.
@ChiefWaffler Its a real shame. If they had sold none of their players they would have a title winning side by now #bbcsportsday
@spudllew #bbcsportsday Doesn't look like its enough money for them.
@brushgently #bbcsportsday Do you think RVP cares about a legacy? He would probably rather move to increase his chances of winning something
@ChiefWaffler I'm still surprised that they didn't break the bank to resign him in the first place. #bbcsportsday
@sixty2major Evra was poor last season. Shame Jordi Alba got snapped up by barca.
@akinbolu Yep I totally understand why he wants to move.
@Linnane90 @bbcsport Do you think that Powell will do well in the EPL straight away? He came up a few divisions didn't he.
I want Berba in the EPL. Swap him with £10m for RVP. He is better than their other strikers anyway #bbcsportsday
@PRO_KA_NCUBE I think Berba + £ is a popular idea. Why not. Berba is better than other Arsenal strikers #bbcsportsday
@ShaneRoberts91 I think Neymar wants to wait another year before inevitably signing for Madrid. #bbcsportsday
RT @benp1a2y3n4e: MUFC need a CM, not RVP. RVP is 29, and why play him if it means that Welbeck, 21, won't get into the team #bbcsportsday
@VivCThornton Hoilett is a great talent. I think Newcastle would do well to get him. #bbcsportsday
@lolwccc Yes #bbcsportsday
@ch4rizard_ LOL.
@crazysupaman Great shout. There's a lot of respect there.
@SimonMarshall6 Kagawa is a gold mine in terms of revenue generation as well. Deffo the best signing #bbcsportsday
@Eriatha I think if Anderson doesn't get injured this season a right back is a required signing. #bbcsportsday
@JB10_ Wigans amazing manager will save them again. #bbcsportsday
@Crippy4Villa agreed. Though I'm not sure how all three would fit in with uniteds formations. Seems like that would kick Valenica out
@michaelmcq totally agree. £17m max. #bbcsportsday
@tapmantwo Do you think its because the rivalry isn't quite so fierce anymore?
@robspitzy Would you rather develop Welb and Chic or get RVP? I'm on the fence at the moment.
@Sc00by87 That would be ideal. Berba is still quality just doesn't seem to fit in at united.
RT @Jook: So I watched a pretty graphic video on youtube of one of the Syrian massacres. Bad move.
@P4tch4riyaholic Its certainly giving Liverpool a bad name
@P4tch4riyaholic yeah welcome to Europe :). I'm glad your settling in.
@P4tch4riyaholic I have no idea Aom. People perhaps wondering where he will it in with Brenden rogers new side. How are you liking Germany?
@P4tch4riyaholic I agree. Do u think he will displace welbeck though? Congrats on the move btw

@P4tch4riyaholic your right. I'm just thinking that Evra is gettin old + was average last season. Leighton Baines is wanted to replace him.
@P4tch4riyaholic I'm not sure how long evra will be at united now. He's getting on in years. He might go to qpr aswell
@P4tch4riyaholic good luck with it all! Sorry to see Park go but at lest he's in the premier league. :)

@P4tch4riyaholic I almost feel sorry for Portugal
@Jook true dat
@Jook bbc's is terrible aswell
RT @Jook: Very enjoyable game. More of the same from Russia and Czech Rep tonight please. #euro2012
@P4tch4riyaholic he's a young attacking midfielder. He will likely be loaned back to his original club
@P4tch4riyaholic So far. I would look forward to another 1 at least. With all the youngsters our team will start to look very different soon
@P4tch4riyaholic I think Giggs could probably retire now. We have enough cover. He is still the best crosser of the ball in the PL though
@P4tch4riyaholic True though it seems that we have far too many midfielders.
@P4tch4riyaholic If he weren't injured all the time he could be very useful. Rio says that him, Clev, Welb and Nani link up very well
@P4tch4riyaholic That is strength in depth
@P4tch4riyaholic Nani can switch with Young or Val. I can come up with 5 different formations with Kagawa and two more without him.
@P4tch4riyaholic I'd assume Anderson as a DM if needed. I'm not sure how necessary they are outside of the Champs League. We need Baines
@P4tch4riyaholic 4-2-3-1. Cleverley Kagawa,Young Rooney Valencia, Welbeck. Could switch to diamond with Clev a DM. Loads out of position tho
@P4tch4riyaholic I think there are 3/4 possible 11's based on opponent. Could be 4-2-3-1
@P4tch4riyaholic assuming fletcher is back what should our midfield be? Could Kagawa be squeezed in
@P4tch4riyaholic don't get me wrong I like his play. He's essentially a better version of Anderson.
@P4tch4riyaholic I like modric. If only he scored more
RT @JamieLaing_UK: Last episode of MIC season 3 this evening.... So sad!! It's gonna be a sick
one though. Who's wants a season 4!! #mad ...
@P4tch4riyaholic hears hoping he proves me wrong. Anderson and cleverley are supposed to have amazing link up play
@P4tch4riyaholic I feel like he would be exceptional if it weren't for injury. I fear he may never reach his potential
@louisegeeee game of thrones is simply amazing. I'f that's what your talking about
@P4tch4riyaholic he's alright tho if it were me I'd sign a left back and a Scholes replacement.
@P4tch4riyaholic nope other than the Japanese guy from borussia Dortmund
RT @P4tch4riyaholic: getting dressed at 3 AM .. not too early...is it? #well-organised
@P4tch4riyaholic two seasons ago all of our attacks came from Evra now its basically none
@P4tch4riyaholic he's 27. I think he would pip evra in the squad now. Evra was poor last season though a good captain.
I am so bored !
@P4tch4riyaholic I think SAF wants to buy Barnes from everton to replace evra
@P4tch4riyaholic it would be interesting. I'm not sure if evra will play for France much more as clichy is coming through.
@P4tch4riyaholic France. They are playing well at the moment and no Rooney. I'm going for a 0-0 as our defence looks awesome at the mo.
@P4tch4riyaholic i think carrick only works with Scholes. That could be the trouble. He was poor in the first half of the season without him
@P4tch4riyaholic apparently he didn't wanna be a bit part player. I sort of understand tbh. England have messed him about over the years
@P4tch4riyaholic he's slow n shocking on the ball. They should have made Scholes n carrick the England midfield
@P4tch4riyaholic I can't stand Barry but lampards had a great season
@P4tch4riyaholic it's gonna be depressing for England as usual

@P4tch4riyaholic newcastle were so close
@P4tch4riyaholic I'm sure it is. Either that or he is guarding his food source
@P4tch4riyaholic She loves climbing my curtains. She occasionally cuddles because I'm warm and as a lizard she is cold.
@P4tch4riyaholic oh dear, not great for a pet to dislike human contact. Penny doesn't like being handled either. I haven't given up tho :)
@P4tch4riyaholic you could cuddle your cat?
@P4tch4riyaholic booze and donuts are my perfect remedy for nerves

RT @P4tch4riyaholic: Come on Newcastle,do us a favour!
@P4tch4riyaholic true. Shame abramovich doesn't seem to work in logic. Let's hope he gets the chance
@P4tch4riyaholic  I think if they win the CL. He will get the job.
@P4tch4riyaholic yeah he's done well. He hasn't had the pressure to change the team like AVB did though.
@P4tch4riyaholic Czech was amazing as usual. If Chelsea win the CL I'll be gutted as they will finish 6th. I dont think they deserved it
@P4tch4riyaholic Ball wasn't over the line, shame for Carroll but well done Chelsea
RT @Jook: Well done @bixboyle who has managed to spot TWO separate fires today and report them to the fire brigade. What a hero.

@P4tch4riyaholic ah ok. So what do u do during the week? Are you a student?
@P4tch4riyaholic that sounds like fun. You should join in. I've got my friend Emma coming over for movies. I must remember to buy popcorn :)
@P4tch4riyaholic absolutely. Do you have any other plans this weekend?
@P4tch4riyaholic just remember it's at old trafford. Let's hope for a win
@P4tch4riyaholic Starting to look like Carroll is coming good finally
@P4tch4riyaholic @epl_live COMMON NORWICH
@OMGitsLexi that's why noone in England washes their cars
@louisegeeee Maybe some sorta owl or eagle, awesome tattoo animals
@louisegeeee of course. It frees up your wrist for future work :)
@louisegeeee ouch, why the removal?
Wigan thoroughly deserved that
@P4tch4riyaholic I think he would do well at spurs. They play with two wingers
@P4tch4riyaholic I hope that one day he will be. He would be a great partner for Rooney up front for England :)

Thank you Arteta you are deffinitely good enough to play CL football next year. Maybe you would like to replace Carrick at United?
@P4tch4riyaholic shit is what it was
RT @Jook: That's the Premier League title wrapped up then. Looking forward to another round of Ferguson vs. Mourinho next year.
@P4tch4riyaholic just need arsenal to do us a favour
@P4tch4riyaholic no need to worry the title is ours
@P4tch4riyaholic sort of. Fergie said it himself it was too comfortable so we weren't trying hard enough. Wigan will be easy next week!

@P4tch4riyaholic so has your cat recovered now? Hoping so
@P4tch4riyaholic since I got my Beardies loads of people have bought them. Everyone who meets them falls in love.They lick u to say hello :)
@louisegeeee Sounds like you need a lion bar to help digest those sandwiches
@P4tch4riyaholic they are misunderstood. I've looked after lots of snakes and never been bitten. They are surprisingly affectionate
@P4tch4riyaholic water dragons only eat meat so crickets etc. I love all reptiles. My dad used to keep snakes when I was a kid
@P4tch4riyaholic yeah us brits just take any excuse to hav a day off. We aren't very religious. Beardies eat crickets and locusts and fruit
@P4tch4riyaholic lol. And were you being sarcastic about April? The more days off the better. Do u have Easter in Bangkok?
@P4tch4riyaholic I have a boy and a girl bearded dragon and a girl water dragon. :)
@P4tch4riyaholic hah :). Penny will lay eggs soon also.. Joy. I have 2 days of cos of Easter so I'm happy. Some serious workouts planned :)
@P4tch4riyaholic hiya Aom how are you? Sakura is my somewhat upset bearded dragon. They go crazy before they lay eggs
@SimonBushell I think I should learn neck stretches
Dammit Sakura if you don't lay your eggs soon I'll go crazy!!!
Every time I play squash my neck kills me
@P4tch4riyaholic huh?
@P4tch4riyaholic what can I say. Young was great again :)
@P4tch4riyaholic I told you !! :)
@P4tch4riyaholic lets see where we are at half time :)
@Jook you loved it
@P4tch4riyaholic drat. I've set myself up for a fall here ;)
@P4tch4riyaholic usually it's a super hard game! Tonight it's all about Valencia. Trust me
@Jook mania was amazing
@P4tch4riyaholic isn't doing it the hard way half the fun?

@P4tch4riyaholic Nothing too intellectual I'm afraid. George R. R Martin and Phillip Pullman books. Fantasy novels really. U?
@P4tch4riyaholic watching fball is a hobby. One I enjoy. I have just started reading more myself. I find it the easiest cure for insomnia
@P4tch4riyaholic it's the one thing I'm sort of good at. I've been playing on and off since I was 6. Do you have any hobbies?
How did city manage a draw out of that ????
@P4tch4riyaholic I'm ok ta. Played 3 hours of squash this morning, body is destroyed lol. necks sorta ok now. Sorry to hear about the bombs
3 hours of squash this morning has destroyed my body. #agony

@P4tch4riyaholic excellent news
@P4tch4riyaholic I'm sure you have other genetic traits that are good. Maybe you could be really good at running
@louisegeeee that is amazing !
Just made 10 miles my bitch #ibringit
@P4tch4riyaholic the downside of the high metabolism is my mate cannot get big muscles. As a man this is a problem
@P4tch4riyaholic I don't believe your fat. Lol. My mate can eat whatever the hell he wants #FFS
@P4tch4riyaholic shame about the aircon. My pale English skin cannot handle heat at all. I have to work out or I would get mega fat ;)
@P4tch4riyaholic I plan to get well during my run tonight. How was your day?
@P4tch4riyaholic age? I'm only 23 lol. Is that old? It's sort of better now ta.
@LexiLex17 thanks for the follow

@P4tch4riyaholic Have you ever been the England and if so, to OT?
@P4tch4riyaholic atmosphere will blow your mind though!

@P4tch4riyaholic that's great news!!!!
@P4tch4riyaholic Damn that's insane. Hows the little man doing?

10 miles made my bitch. A great night.

@P4tch4riyaholic yes he is, my beloved Valencia

@P4tch4riyaholic what subjects are you doing?
@Jook quality shoot out
@P4tch4riyaholic ouch. "shudders" hope that gets better soon
@P4tch4riyaholic yep always the way. Hope your not injured too much with your slip
@P4tch4riyaholic yeah Liverpool always do well against us it seems.
@P4tch4riyaholic didn't look too be at the time. Let's hope not as we cannot replace him
@P4tch4riyaholic your right. I think arsenal changed their tempo slightly and it made a difference
@P4tch4riyaholic I think it was a deliberate performance in order to control the game. Nani did well also
@P4tch4riyaholic good game in the second half. Chamberlain looks very decent
@P4tch4riyaholic I told you !! :)
Valencia!!!!!
@P4tch4riyaholic on for giggs most likely

@P4tch4riyaholic glad it all went well at the dentist. I must admit it one of y fears. I avoid dentistry wherever possible
@P4tch4riyaholic most successful manager in British football history. The guy knows all. Glad the dentist went well btw.
@Jook us as long as china isn't involved
Swansea look awesome
@P4tch4riyaholic true it's just so much better economically to have most of your players from your academy. Look at Barcelona
@P4tch4riyaholic the others were ok. I'm waiting for cleverley to come back. He really makes the team.
@P4tch4riyaholic I was playing a squash tournament today but I listened to the game. Valencia was awesome and so was welbeck.
@P4tch4riyaholic the money they are on Is stupid
@P4tch4riyaholic I think there's some pride in it. He doesn't think they're worth the money so won't pay it even of he really wants them.
@P4tch4riyaholic welbeck looks awesome at the mo. no further news on the want away youth players

@jessicaann8091 left or right?
@Jook sweet
@jessicaann8091 how's your head this morning?
@Jook did u have a good birthday mate?
RT @cmcgovern: My irony meter may have just exploded... http://t.co/clfD2PBG
@jessicaann8091 nice. Let's face it if your not working tomorrow you don't need short term memory anyway
@P4tch4riyaholic yes it does. United have brought through great talent recently I don't know why they would want to leave
@P4tch4riyaholic I think pogba will be better anyway. Glad to talk to another supporter. My friends are football people
Man that whole bag of jelly babies isn't sitting well #bigmistake
@jessicaann8091 how'd the partying go?
@P4tch4riyaholic no idea. To be honest it will be made up like most twitter news. Do u think he should leave?
@P4tch4riyaholic no idea. He seems pretty decent
@OfficialKat just watched your film with Michael Cera. Pure quality. Maybe he will appear on #2brokegirls

@angelicaaacaa ouch. I ditched that at gcse and just did the sciences. They may be hard but you can get better marks
@jessicaann8091 well it's the end of the working day. Should be little to stop you.
@angelicaaacaa if you get all of the answers right in Mathis you get 100% but if you do an English essay it is impossible to get 100%
@jessicaann8091 classic
@angelicaaacaa Dw at least you can actually get 100% on the exam
@Jook hmm I know what a hot office is like though the IT people love it

@rioferdy5 it all depends on manning. Go giants #giants

@Jook it's the sort of thing that he would do
@Jook wow. Did she not smell
Watching match of the day. My god Sturridge is awesome

@Jook it's rich people who think that they have difficult lives
@DanielleYvettee what's your prediction for next week?
@Colette_luke can we really blame Rosie for sleeping with Hugo he is so awesome. Not that I'm jealous
@harryturner19 normally she gets no action at all. Now look at her
@terrimurtagh seconded
@MSMITH7777 my guess is that Rosie and Hugo hooked up but I don't quite believe it.
@liinnddsseey because it is just so darn good
@lincoln18 the only problem with this episode was that there wasn't much Francis
@DanielleYvettee I cannot believe how good it is.
@amyjaneward @millsmackintosh I literally cannot wait
@EllieMorley95 it is Sooooooo Good
What's people's opinion on the walking dead #Thewalkingdead
I meant my god
Mine God made in Chelsea is amazing
@Jook it's totally totally shit
@louannegiovan I saw the work sirloin and needed to read no more. Awesome!
@misstoriblack I was sick a few weeks ago the new iPhone made me feel better
Uncle Ben's chilli con carne is supposed to have the taste of Mexico. This cannot be a good thing.
@taylormomsen when do we get to hear your new stuff?? Cannot wait
@imdavidhaughton nice. Think about the pay day
@junior_cigano well done Junior!
@iSexstrology well as a Gemini thank goodness.

I really can't be doing with work tomorrow
@OMGitsLexi *mine
@OMGitsLexi I write peoples names in mind

@CMPunk I guess there are some English wrestlers
@SarahSwagg_ so what is the homework?
@SarahSwagg_ it's the benefit of having finish university.
@Jook you really should might take your mind off various illnesses.
@SarahSwagg_ man I'm so glad I don't have homework anymore
@kylieireland hi Kylie I'm trying to find your movies online I'm having trouble finding places to buy them could you recommend any?
@ManUtdUK I think you will end out as a permanent sub purely because of his explosive speed.
@SarahSwagg_ might be a good reason to get the undertaker back in the ring
@ChuckLiddell I don't see anyone beating Jones.
@SarahSwagg_ there's always Zack Ryder
@SarahSwagg_ I think that CM punk would make the wwe title picture exciting again. I also like the miz
@SarahSwagg_ really. Who do u think he wouldnt beat. Cena?
RT @undeux: Photo: Persimmon smoothie and my shirt says fuck. :) http://t.co/VdH69mDK
@Jook I remain unconvinced
@Jook @imdavidhaughton we need to get jook some surgery. That solves everything
@Jook she's why xfactor is not relevant. There is no talent in england
@OMGitsLexi what colour squirrels do u have where you live? We have red ones here
@SarahSwagg_ heya. Do you think CM Punk will win the title at his next opportunity? I'm betting not
@clubalektrablue good morning. Are you gonna watch the NFL later?

@StuartRowson totally agree. Parker was amazing. Buy of the season
@Jook it's so true
@undeux i used to think the same. Naruto ended up having a much better storyline, give the manga a read of your bored. There's an app :)
@undeux hey April. Have you ever watched Naruto? I would highly recommend it.
@Jook what can I say I'm a new age shaman
@Jook awesome. I knew I'd get you to sleep

@rioferdy5 what do you think of Phil jones in midfield later?
@JackWilshere what do you think of Phil jones in midfield later?
