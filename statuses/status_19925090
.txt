@AndrewSBowen @thepaulguy @SexyNerdGirl @RockJocksMovie Looks like y'all are having a blast!!!
@KeithAllGamer It always seems a little awkward because you're basically paying to spend time with them.
@KeithAllGamer Oh and I also spend too much money in the Walk of Fame :)
@KeithAllGamer Nice. I've never stayed at a Host hotel. Then again last time I went, I didn't get much sleep.
@KeithAllGamer Ouch! 8 hours for me. Then there's finding a place to sleep, food, tickets, merch...
@KeithAllGamer Yeah I'm not even going to Dragon Con this year because of costs. :(
@KeithAllGamer It pains me to read the goings on at #sdcc and not be able to be there...
@KeithAllGamer I grew up on the cartoons. And the action figures. I think a standalone movie of just Stormshadow and Snake Eyes would work.
@KeithAllGamer I actually liked the first one... For what it was. As long as I didn't look to hard for the G.I. Joe's of my youth.
Sorry @therock, G.I. Joe Retaliation was such a letdown. Especially without Scarlett. @rachelnichols1
