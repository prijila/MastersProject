@OC_CPMatthew if your a fan of the alien series I would get it cheap on steam or when it hits the bargain baskets.. 6/10 for me
@OC_CPMatthew and ignore fellow marines deciding to attack you rather than you colleagues.. Even if they are on top of them..
@OC_CPMatthew the sound is though especially with headphones or surround sound.. AI is a joke the aliens seem to jump in front of your gun
@OC_CPMatthew had such high expectations and technology has moved on since production started on this game.. The graphics aren't great
@OC_CPMatthew after a day with the game I can say its not as bad as some of the reviews, it plays like a 5 year old FPS, trouble is we all

@The_Dno @BestDutch did see you on it mate.. Wondered what you thought, tbh thinking of trading it tomorrow
@KoiNoYokan2381 @BestDutch it feels like aliens, but gameplay  is dated.. Plays like quake 4 when first came out on 360 at launch

Rant over
My two girlies love them both to bits. http://t.co/gxPhCarz
Or Liza and if I say one certain word.. Then her breed takes over.. I certain wouldn't like to be in her way when that happens
My dog is my best friend I love her to bits, she's the biggest softy you'll ever meet until you try and break into the house, upset me
You in those living conditions bored out of your brain and living in shit you'd be slightly pissed off and aggressive
Dogs can turn aggressive when they don't get walked ever, are beaten every day and fed rubbish and live in faeces.. Think about it if it was
And not the breed..my dog is my life, gets walked twice a day for 45 mins each, has training sessions once a week.. It's a wonder why these
Just finished watching deathrow dogs on iplayer.. Such a shame some really nice dogs put to sleep because of breed. We should blame owners
Thankfully @LeezaE has walked Skye and put tea on... #verylucky guess a massage would be pushing it #iwish
Just back in from work, got a stomping head ache and think my neck problem is starting up again..
