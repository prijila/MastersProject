@tonybrammer how dare they hope for food and shelter.
@SeleneAddams @gspvfc @tonybrammer @SkyNews It seems your compassion runs out far sooner. Happily others have more.
@SeleneAddams it will if we don't all help. Europe is a big (and rich) place.
@tonybrammer @SeleneAddams @gspvfc @SkyNews they don't ask for your wealth, just your hearts. Guess that is in short supply too...
@tonybrammer clearly you are not up to speed on any of the complexities... Hungary is one that closed the border
@SeleneAddams @gspvfc @tonybrammer @SkyNews Lebanon has taken 25% of their population. Maybe they are more resourceful...
@tonybrammer I'd point out that the rocks are thrown in frustration, but your mind is as closed as that border.
@SeleneAddams @gspvfc @tonybrammer @SkyNews therecan't be a "but" at the end of a sentance like that... there just can't be.
@SeleneAddams the large numbers are made up of individuals. That they all need help at the same time speaks to thd desperate situation
@tonybrammer you help your wife too? Sainthood on its way.
@SeleneAddams @gspvfc @tonybrammer @SkyNews BUILD? In Syria? Have you not seen anything to suggest that might not happen for a few years?
@tonybrammer so begin helping them too üòÉ Oh wait, did you give them ¬£6.50 per year too?
@SeleneAddams it does. But that is not a quick fix and innocent people should not suffer needlessly in the meantime

@SeleneAddams @tonybrammer @SkyNews would you not be angry?
First safe haven is Turkey, 1.6million there already. We must all help

@Synead2me I saw charges on my card and thought I had a chance, but no. No email = no tickets. Card showed pre-authorisation, not charged.
@Audz_Fulham fingers crossed
@Audz_Fulham you might be in the same boat as me... Might be worth emailing help@ to find out.
@Audz_Fulham did you get your confirmation email?
@Audz_Fulham yes, those are just pre-authorisations
@Audz_Fulham I just got confirmation that I DO NOT have tickets. Hooefully you have better luck.
@Audz_Fulham hopefully. I know others with emails, but nothing on their cards. Fingers crossed they all go through.
@Audz_Fulham did you get a confirmation email? My card shows charges, but I got no email...
