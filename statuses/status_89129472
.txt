@LuvTLC @martins4xf @TravisR_girl Yes but was he B613 also?
@martins4xf @LuvTLC @TravisR_girl Yes, I remember but was Fitz B613? Or just military?
@TravisR_girl @LuvTLC Of course - that may not ever get answered as that's not really what the show is about.
@TravisR_girl @LuvTLC What/who was Rowan/Eli b4 he was Command?
@TravisR_girl @LuvTLC b4 he and Liv connected. It seems like yes but at times it seems like no.
@TravisR_girl @LuvTLC Liv was a "job" for Jake.  He was hired by her dad and by Fitz.  My big question is was Fitz ever connected to Rowan
