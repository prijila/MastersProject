In 2000, four superstars joined WWE after leaving WCW. The four superstars included Eddie Guerrero, Dean Malenko, Perry Saturn. #Radicalz
11 years ago at #SummerSlam in Toronto, Randy Orton "found" the World Heavyweight Championship after it went "missing" at WrestleMania XX.

Who needs WWE when I have @smashwrestling @ringofhonor @IMPACTWRESTLING @GFWWrestling and other promotions to support?
@WillieStufff I didn't.
Out of the three Shield members, I've always thought Ambrose and Rollins had the potential to be stars. Reigns not so much.
I take that back. Lesnar always looks bored when on WWE TV.
Roman Reigns is so boring. Even Lesnar looks bored.
Even Paul Heyman can't make me interested in this match.
@Dina7810 @Ponyzord @smashwrestling Smart decision.

And, yes, the main event was Tommy Dreamer vs Rosey. The show ended with a recently unmasked Kane assaulting everyone in sight.
