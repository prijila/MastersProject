Watching tv.
Going to gun store - then playing bass.
http://bit.ly/apmSew Huffpost -
Time to plug in 5 string and groove...
Hope everyone is alive after last night.  Still highly impressed w/ McJunkin's bass tone / playing (from Portland).
Getting ready to go to sleep - then wake the fuck up and sell something.
Putting the kiddies to bed & watching Wubzy.
@modulusguitars Any new news / updates regarding the VJ series?  Cant wait to get one.
@dannylohner Happy belated b-day!  PS - Zon or Modulus?
Ahhh, 6:30am.  TIme to get up and go to work...and most importantly; sell something.
Bass guitar...give daughters a bath...put dogs in kennel...go back to sleep & go to work tomorrow.
RT @dannylohner: Wanna hear what's 'actually' coming out of Britney Spear's mouth when she's dancin around on stage? http://tinyurl.com/ ...
Taking mom & aunt back to Portland, OR airport.  I will miss them.
@PazLenchantin as a bass player, "Judith" is one of my all time fav. bass lines.  Good job.
Getting ready to go with family to x-mas tree farm to chop down tree & bring home...in the mountains of Orygun.
Mom is coming tomorrow from NJ to visit.  Gonna go chop down a X-mas tree and put it up on Saturday.
@mjkeenan R U f'ing kidding me?  We paid $366 for those seats in Portland because to us it was once in a lifetime opportunity.  What a d-bag
Dillema; new Zon or new Modulus???
@AICJerry Merry Christmas Jerry - btw, your new G&L kicks balls!
Just got home from work.  My daughters 3 yrs and 1 yr are unbelievable.  I am lucky to have them.  Plus, they like playing electric bass!
@mattmcjunkins Kick balls tonight...wish we could be there.
Playing 5 string right now....
Bedtime. Peace.
@AICJerry Happy Thanksgiving!
Day started right.  My one year old is on the tweet already.  She's happy.
Down for the night.  See you tomorrow.
on Mac Book....getting ready to go to work...but tonight starts a 4 day weekend.  Late.
@carinaround He said something like "I know Milla was involved with the project, so I thought it was her."  Lame...
@timalexander People do that all the time at my work.  I hear them take a massive growler then they just walk right out of the restroom.
@timalexander
@carinaround I already did a couple of days ago and got a response from him...I can send you the e-mail exchange privately if you wish.
Cant sleep anymore.  Watching To Live & Die in LA - trying Zinc to see if that helps with sickness.
@mjkeenan Suit looks sharp - kill it 2night.
@carinaround Nice!  Hope you have a great set!  Your voice is killer.
Plugging into SansAmp VT Bass and now playing...
Sicker than shit.  Fever...throwing up.  Only thing that seems to help is vicodin.
I'm out.  Late.
Home from work.  Throat feels like lit gasoline was poured down it.
@JeffFriedl If you play 1/2 as good as you did on 11/16 - you will kick balls.  Have fun!
@carinaround I sent the reviewer an e-mail reprimanding him for using erroneous info in his review.  Told him he should be ashamed.
Woke up w/ sore throat...sucks...but its' Friday.  F it.
@carinaround The way you guys play DoZo & Momma Sed live.  Incredible.   Great work.
Plugging in the Zon...time to play & chill a little bit.
@mattmcjunkins Thanks for posting that.  Mesa 400+ kicks balls.  I think they stopped making them though.
@carinaround No kidding.  I read some jackhole's review of one of the Salt Lake shows and he said Milla was singing. Dumbass.
@timalexander Great to see you play in Portland.  Last time I saw you was at the Roseland but in NYC w/ Primus & Mike Watt - 1995.
Staring at a Mac Book.
