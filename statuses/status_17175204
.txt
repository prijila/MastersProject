Since a clean install of iOS9 my iPhone battery is amazing. Love this update for efficiency.

Started trimming my iPhone distractions. First thing to go, Instagram. Only used for filters so don’t need the social feed (distraction)
I really like the new Google logo. Its fresh and current.
I think I even prefer the whole #Spotify look and experience too. I love that hold and listen feature so much.
Annoys me that Spotify does a better job of music recommendations than Apple Music. I want to love Apple Music I really do #Spotify

@GemmaWithG sweet. Now I want pizza.
@GemmaWithG fish on a pizza? That cheese has gone to your head haha.
@GemmaWithG folding a pizza is the way forward. Although id give up a fold for a stuff crust with cheese any day.
Egg and Chorizo Burritos http://t.co/vUCxh52fRw I want these in my face right now.
@GemmaWithG actually had one of those too although not a big fan. Lots of grisly bits.
@GemmaWithG I'd fly that flag. I had pizza the other night with donor meat on it. Was sexy.
@GemmaWithG dinner of the gods right there. Where's the mayo though?
My earphones are officially broken in one ear.

@GemmaWithG No idea but if I see you holding it that way I'LL KILL YOU.
@marcleigh I do however love the photos service but it insists on trying to get me to post onto G+ Might just use Flickr.
@marcleigh Wish they would just ditch Google+ and let us use the photos service without it. Love Google but I don't want/need Google+
