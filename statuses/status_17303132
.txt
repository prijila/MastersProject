@normangoldman you may want to mention WHY the TPP affects ALL of us by becoming the 'law of the land' - overriding our existing laws, etc.
@TheDailyRep one would think so, but then THEY couldn't alter votes in their favor. GOP S.O.P.: blame the other guy for what you do.
@TheDailyRep Don't forget Rove freaking out when the vote he rigged went the other way. Righties claim its liberals hacking voting machines.

@normangoldman Agree - however, they'd rather drag that fight out for as long as they can. SCOTUS is of primary concern - possibly singular.
