@Bett_show Cheers for #Bettchat today. It was really good.
I have to say @TheRock was outstanding in Snitch. Good job, man!
@Bett_show @grumbledook @Danjjroberts #Bettchat On a serious note though, I have found MFL have been great at using tech in their lessons!
@grumbledook @Bett_show @Danjjroberts #Bettchat I bet UKIP are very angry about all these new fangled languages.

@grumbledook @Danjjroberts @Bett_show #Bettchat And I messed around a lot. That didn't help.
@grumbledook @Danjjroberts @Bett_show #Bettchat I got an F for French at school. Struggled with the accent &amp; felt self conscious   about it.
@Danjjroberts @Bett_show Haha...merci! *Del Boy accent*
@Bett_show #Bettchat Social media is a powerful tool and voice for all. It is our choice how accessible we are to students.
@Bett_show #Bettchat Yes...well...they need support in some form.
@Danjjroberts @Bett_show French...I already have some very basic knowledge.  The App was brilliant. #Bettchat
@Danjjroberts @Bett_show I tried once using an iPad app, really enjoyed it but basically ran out of time in my days. #Bettchat

@Bett_show #Bettchat It is obviously not as simple as that. I think that the food producers should take more responsibility that tech.
@Bett_show #Bettchat I think parents need to take some responsibility and people should stop blaming tech. Take your kids for a walk.
@Bett_show #Bettchat There is def, I just think coding has overshadowed everything else. Poss because of us all talking about it. ;-)
RT @grumbledook: @ianaddison @Danjjroberts @mattbritland @Bett_show @YEUK2012 computational thinking is the transferable skill, not coding?
@jbclarke @Bett_show @YEUK2012 #Bettchat Yes...I can imagine coding skills are important in that line of work. :-)
@Bett_show @YEUK2012 Interesting,I suspect the majority of people will never need to code, they will need to use tech and use it creatively.

@Bett_show @YEUK2012 #Bettchat Although, coding does teach important transferable skills used everyday.
@Bett_show @YEUK2012 #Bettchat Wow...what a question. Hmmm...I would say that Maths and English are used everyday, coding is not.
@YEUK2012 @Bett_show #Bettchat Completely agree with you!
@YEUK2012 @Bett_show #Bettchat Looking forward seeing that.
RT @YEUK2012: @mattbritland @Bett_show 1.We are working on an IT careers feature for our next Youth Employment eMag so looking at this now
RT @YEUK2012: @mattbritland @Bett_show 2. Worryingly in many cases it is "everyday" skills that are not there, spreadsheets, word processing
@Danjjroberts @YEUK2012 @Bett_show #Bettchat Probably not...I don't think the new Computing POS will help either.
@Bett_show #Bettchat Programs 4 parents at school, more government led initiatives, ISPs stepping 2 help their subscribers. It's tough tho.
@YEUK2012 @Bett_show #Bettchat Def...how do we prioritise these skills? Will the majority of employers value coding or more traditional ICT?

@Bett_show #Bettchat Collaboration is the key to a more even educational playing field for all.

@HoldHeadUpHigh that includes a licence for the desk top version as well and on 5 computers, plus the apps. So it isn't too bad.
@HoldHeadUpHigh Yeah...I love Google Drive. It's just the functionality if Office on iPad is very good from the reviews I have read.
RT @loudmouthmelvin: What a goal
@MrMalcontent I think it's £79 a year. Not too bad if I am honest. Will try and get it through work.
@mr_ajp Yeah there is that. I use Pages usually but the new Apps look really good.
I really want Microsoft Office for iPad. Looks outstanding but I can't bring myself to pay £99 a year.
