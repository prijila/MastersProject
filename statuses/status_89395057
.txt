To all those saying #FuckBlackHistoryMonth Dr. Woodson, black, started BHM in 1926  national attention to the lack of black in history books
To all those saying #FuckBlackHistoryMonth BHM was necessary bc back in 1926, black contributions weren‚Äôt included in history books.
To all those saying #FuckBlackHistoryMonth You do realize that is was created by a black man in 1926 named Dr Carter G Woodson.

@thatjoshbell Therefore no matter what faith you are or what you believe I will extend an open hand as long as you're willing to receive it.
@thatjoshbell That's an argument for a scholar on the subject. I believe in the basic tenant that all of man should be good to all of man
@thatjoshbell Not all musilims are homophobic, women-stoners. Just like all Mormons aren't Romney or all Black people aren't criminals.
@thatjoshbell Exactly. Blame those that won't use it. Not the people as a whole.
@thatjoshbell It's more a matter of common sense than anything.
@thatjoshbell regardless of faith. Christianity pretty much told me not to masturbate or I'm hellbound. I have lake-of-fire front property.
@thatjoshbell We need to focus on those that try to prevent unity and eradicate hatred as opposed to grouping the sour w/ the sweet apples.
@thatjoshbell Those are antiquated notions and many people want those to change. Being that I'm not muslim, I can't speak for muslims.
@thatjoshbell Human interpretation is what causes mayhem and chaos, not the faith itself.
@thatjoshbell Every faith has it's faults and no one faith is perfect. The core belief of most faiths, incl. muslims: be good to each other
@nottjmiller I like the cut of your jibb Mr. Miller.
@thatjoshbell No point in balancing them. You can argue either until blue-faced. I accept indiviuals regardless of their faith. I like ppl.
@thatjoshbell One is subterfuge for the sake of survival amongst hostility where the other is a complete abandonment of your faith.
@thatjoshbell Sure. it's the denial of one's faith in the face of bullying, abuse or mistreatment.
