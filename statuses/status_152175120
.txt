@SAADIQTAJ but the face of the industry is the deep pockets that control the major companies and who has been in the game so long.
@SAADIQTAJ . Now you do not need a major label or large record company at all.  You can self publish and keep all the pie
@SAADIQTAJ the Internet and iTunes changes the entire game of music.
@SAADIQTAJ you also have to understand the structure. Labels, company's, etc.
@SAADIQTAJ nah not so... From my sources.  Remember Motown the only successful company.  We really have to break it down by years and genres
@SAADIQTAJ now with the independent labels they own less, but they still do the major distribution.
@SAADIQTAJ they have always owned the companies. There are only a few that owned their own, such as Luther Cambell, &amp; Percy Miller

@SAADIQTAJ ok mindless tv is on I must excuse myself from the discussion. üòë
@SAADIQTAJ so you see the "program" these dudes are multimillion assets to the PWIs. Athletics are big business! But back to you subject
@SAADIQTAJ riddle me this, would the HBCU need the extra funding if they had the same athletic programs as the PWIs? Hmmm
@SAADIQTAJ it's a fact they do receive less funding than the PWI of comparable size.
@SAADIQTAJ now that's was some time ago... When I was in school. üòé
@SAADIQTAJ considering I've attended both PWI &amp; HBCU. Truth is I only was encouraged to give back to the community at the HBCU.
@SAADIQTAJ mouth full... Put it all on faith... "Jesus gone take care of me" üòÜ
@SAADIQTAJ you must factor in its rather difficult to liberate when that community isn't interested.
@SAADIQTAJ the products of HBCU's are sprinkled through out many communities making huge impacts. Same concept for HBGLOs
@SAADIQTAJ I'm sure there is some truth to how black institutions have failed to live up to their responsibility as a institution however
@SAADIQTAJ now i must agree that the black community has failed to support HBCU's
@SAADIQTAJ please expound on how that is factual.
