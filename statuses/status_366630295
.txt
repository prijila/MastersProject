No Old Trafford trip this year, gutted.
@andywiz miserable behind the sticks
@andywiz enjoying the Wigan Support? Poor effort from the saints fans....Wigan by 2 I reckon.

RT @davidfordisdead: i have 2 new records out on itunes today. That's right, two. FORD4.1 is an EP of new songs (and one re-conditioned  ...
Wigan Warriors, hardest team to beat, best supported club now, and history of Super league. Wire!, beat us when it matters, oh you can't!
