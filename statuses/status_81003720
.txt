You raced to the line using the fastest speed but your partner was moving slow like a snail. You can do nothing but waiting for that baton.
Perception IS reality.
I hate that when people manipulate you and the situation to make you have no controls, you can do nothing but waiting in the dark room.
PLAY like a little kid, LOVE like you never get hurt. Be vulnerable, and let go. #ThoughtsForActing
The moment when you understand what "priority" really means. Other things can all wait, but this can not.
People say the most sexiest moment about your lover is when s/he is focusing on something s/he loves and is good at it. I think it is true.
Just do what your heart tells you to do. Don't be afraid and don't regret. Trust.
It becomes so easy when you got that never-ending desire. #DreamBig

哎。叹一声，butterflies这个东西真的是个奇妙的东西啊。有了，就莫名其妙又了。没有，也是没有任何原因的就没有。
One of my weaknesses is: I cannot "take it easy" :(
I guess I am too devoted to ....almost everything
“But I dunno how to make coffee,'ve never done it before”-"Well,if u can learn howto use FinalCutPro,Im sure u can learn how to make coffee"
it happens when you least expect it
The thing I love and hate abut #FinalCutPro is: you can never fully understand him. So many mysteries, so many challenges
just had a strong #dejavu when Iwas talking to my coworkers,I even knew what they're gonna say before they said it. It was weird and scary
Today Im hosting a dinner night for my dear friends.Havenot been cooking for a long time,almost forgot Im a born amazing cook! no kidding.^^
#survivor I really canNOT find one guy sexier than @BostonRob You are on fire HOT. Period.
#survivor How can you not love Philip? haha
Have 6 video projects in hand: one is for MOHAI, 5 for the Seattle Times. (working on 2, 3 more are coming)
I really cannot be happier. :)
Way back into old times. didnot like it quite much though. I guess I am a better person now?...I've decided to be a better person! I will.
interning is like dating. The two need to get to know each other and decide if this could be a long-term relationship:)
Filling out graduation documents.Feeling a little heartache. Goodbye UW! Now its time from school to the society. Real life begins!
@yellowbirdhn haha,not "know nothing about English",I knew a few, not much.But I didnt speak it before I came here.my starting point was low
@DrZia pls let me know when you got the answer
#ThePursuitOfHappyness.It reminds me the time when Iwas hiding in bathroom learning English to prepare my GRE test w/o letting company know
I've decided to take a good rest tonight. No working at all!!

告诉自己不要放弃，一定会有幸福的，可说着说着，自己都觉得没底气，只觉得委屈的想哭。在追逐梦想里，我有执着的信念；可是在爱情里，我太心灰意冷了。我觉得上帝遗忘我了。。。没有一个人分享世界，我得到了整个世界又如何呢？

Maybe imperfection is just the LIFE itself.Maybe there is no such "perfect" thing that I have been seeking.Then what?Should I stop dreaming?
Life is an illusion. why you are chasing something so hard..
OK! I am making a horor movie! wait for it! :)
how many times of falling down would make you quit getting up? #jobhunting

depressed by the endless depressing rain.......................
Learn to be grateful to life, and appreciate what we have. There is really nothing to complain about. Everything is going to be just fine!
same place, same window, same table, same chair, same smell of coffee. Everything is the same, but it's all changed.
In autumn, every leaf is a flower.
Happy National Day!
One of my best friend is getting married today, and today is also her ex-boyfriend's wedding day. Life is funny sometimes.

no job, no income, no home, no life, no future...I donot deserve any relationship at this time. Have to survive first!
Wonder: Where the universe came from? Why the universe exists? What outside the universe? I would rather die for the answers.
Am I a control freak?I just love everything to be exactly what I want it to be?and hard to accept changes?Tell me,whoever knows me well
