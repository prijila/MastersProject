@maro254: #RosewaterRumble Round 15: (The Finals) Ravnica (#1). Best. Set. Ever. Plus turned me from a casual into a serious magic player.
@maro254: #RosewaterRumble Round 14: (second semi-final round) Innistrad (#2).
@wobbles @lee_sharpe @maro254 I'd say it makes a lot of sense. If it is favourite, then you don't really need reasons in different match-ups
@maro254: #RosewaterRumble Round 13: (1st semi-final match) Ravnica (#1). (still) Best. Set. Ever. ZDK was fun. RVN was epic.
@maro254: #RosewaterRumble, Round 12: Ravnica (#1). Best. Set. Ever.
@maro254 #RosewaterRumble Round 11: Innistrad (#2). Played both only in limited and while ISD was loads of fun, I'm still undecided on GTC.
@maro254: #RosewaterRumble Round 9: (1st Quarter Final Match): Mirrodin (#5). Enjoyed both, but this was my first ever, so sentimental value
@maro254: #RosewaterRumble Round 8: Ravnica (#1). Best. Set. Ever.
@arseblog this is not PL where you can kick a team that does not like it up 'em.
@arseblog their off tue ball movement is so much better than Arsenal's... If they can keep this for 90 minutes, I fear an emphatic loss.
