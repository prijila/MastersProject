Thought you should know.
Vol. 1 was brill, and Vol. 3 (ha) is almost as good. "New Blue Moon," "Poor House," "Runaway" and "Wilbury Twist" are the standouts
Good gawd, the #TravelingWilburys are fannntastic
Oh man, #MistressAmerica really is just fantastic. One of the best of the year. Hilarious, painfully witty, and sweet and lovely to boot.

@davedavieskinks I salute you sir!
"Upset, sadness, madness, happiness. That's what life is!‚Äù Too right, Dave
"It's not easy listening. It's not even comfortable to listen to. It was meant to evoke uncertainty and insecurity."
I think Dave Davies got it right; it's quite a ride: "When you play the whole body of work, you get tossed all over the place."
Though ‚ÄúTake me back to the black hills, that I have never seen‚Äù from Muswell Hillbilly is too!
"If I live too long I'm afraid I'll die" from Strangers is a standout.
Lyrics-wise, Ray Davies may be unparalleled for astounding consistency of near-perfect lines.
Listen to The Kinks. They're vunderbar
And 'The Village Green Preservation Society' too! God, they're good.
Though 'Arthur' is stupendous, and 'Lola Versus Powerman' has limitlessly brilliant material.
'Muswell Hillbillies' was a standout; maybe their best production.
After 23 hours worth of 24 albums, spanning 29 years and taking me 19 days, I'm bushed, but I'm sure they're one of the greatest bands ever.
Well, that's that. I've now listened to every #Kinks album ever, in order.

10/10 #Hamilton
The most inspiring, admirable play I have ever seen. And I thought long and hard about that.
HAMILTON IS FUCKING INCREDIBLE
The most fun and intriguing Kinks album since Muswell Hillbillies. 'Destroyer' and 'Better Things' are just brill. #Kinksploration
Give The People What They Want, however, is just fantastic! #Kinksploration
One For The Road was good, but doesn't live up to what a Kinks live album should be. (Unrelentingly wild with reckless abandon, that is)
WITNESS ME
On to "Low Budget," which is already reminding me how much I love 'Catch Me Now I'm Falling' #Kinksploration
'Misfits' was disappointing, though the title track is pretty great. #Kinksploration
'Juke Box Music' is phenomenal; the title track is catchy and bold; and 'Brother' is subversive but a masterpiece.
Sleepwalker is a triumph when you think about it. It must rank highly on 'Great Albums That Followed Very Not-Great Albums' #Kinksploration
I agree with most, the theatrical period we could have done without, but it does make 'Sleepwalker' that much better as a return to form
Currently 15 albums deep into my exploration of every #Kinks album, in order. Or #Kinksploration if you will.
"Upset, sadness, madness, happiness. That's what life is!" - Dave Davies, hitting the nail on the head.
"It's not even comfortable to listen to. It was meant to evoke uncertainty and insecurity."

Similar reliance on pivotal events in our young lives, very different focuses.

@CliftonDuncanIV and it's a shame, but I think there is a lot of that going on in this play. Too much for me to enjoy it, unfortunately.
@CliftonDuncanIV I suppose my point is, when Black actors play certain roles to certain audiences, I think nasty subliminal themes come up.
@CliftonDuncanIV Maybe that's just my vantage point, but have you felt any of that?
@CliftonDuncanIV I felt like I was in the 1940s. People were guffawing at any sequence that ridiculed or subjugated your character.
@CliftonDuncanIV Of which there were a few too many, I might add.
@CliftonDuncanIV When I saw it, the (significant majority white) audience couldn't stop laughing at the jokes at Caliban's expense.
@CliftonDuncanIV But the audience gets impressions, that cannot be denied. And that's what made me so uncomfortable watching The Tempest.
@CliftonDuncanIV Yes, it is wonderful that Black actors are employed at all, and they will benefit from stagetime/screentime, I get that.
@CliftonDuncanIV I like what you wrote friend, and I agree for the most part, but I can't help feeling there's another side here.
@CliftonDuncanIV ought to say, you were great in the tempest, but weren't the slavery references a bit, well, heavy handed?

#BlackLivesMatter is the most basic, obvious, essential message but it seems it just never sank in for so much of white America. #Shame
Scared for good reason, because a policeman had a gun pointed at him for nothing (so I have heard). Think about that then get back to me.
That's such an insidious trend. "Well, he did something wrong, so stop blaming the cop." #RumainBrisbon was a human being and he was scared.
Today someone said I shouldn't be upset about #RumainBrisbon cos he ran. I don't care if he ran. He did not deserve to die. I will be upset.
Somehow, @runjewels your music is really what's getting me through this shit. Thank you. #BlackLivesMatter

@aaronpaul_8 Thank you. @88FingersEdward citizens do not deserve police brutality. Ever. The police are supposed to be better than that.
@ManMadeMoon Thank you for your words tonight about #EricGarner, also. It's reassuring to see your favorite artists contributing like you do
@ManMadeMoon I think it has gotten a lot better. Nice to know some places are on better sides of history than others.
@ManMadeMoon well, that's not quite fair of me, but it is the same result. I.e., more white cops in Black neighborhoods.
@ManMadeMoon Interestingly, Missouri probably encourages low-IQ cops for the same reason that DC discourages non-college educated cops
@ManMadeMoon By that I mean cops who have no connections to the areas they police. It's a problem here in DC for sure, and leads to distrust
@ManMadeMoon Yeah, I really agree with you, I find that horrendous. But the second part of my reply is that leads to unfamiliar cops.
@ManMadeMoon It's actually the opposite. Often many street smart cops are denied jobs because they do not have a college education.

What appropriate words. "I can't breathe." Seems like none of us can breathe in this country without deserving to die in someone's eyes.
Because you could go out tomorrow and be killed by a man in a badge and some people will see nothing wrong with that. #EricGarner

The ONLY way the murder of Eric Garner is justified is because he is not truly valued as fully human.

Congratulations, America(ns). You've disgusted me more than ever. #FergusonDecision #mikebrownverdict
It occurs to me now how racist it is that so many assume violence is the inevitable next step when Black protesters get involved. #Ferguson
@amandaetcetera yeah I'm realizing I'm done laughing when I see this bigotry. It's sad and disgusting and needs to be gone immediately
@amandaetcetera I have never felt this enraged. Read the conversation I just had with a not terribly enlightened woman. It's eye-opening.
Good night, @RebeccaKearney7 think it over, then maybe try helping instead of calling people out for being mad about travesties. #Ferguson
@RebeccaKearney7 I'm trying to help you. You don't have to be so aggressive. You just do not understand what it is like to be Black here.
@RebeccaKearney7 I've found something. You don't want Blacks protesting at all do you? You want me to shut up cos you can't face yourself.
@RebeccaKearney7 Do you think people should protest the #FergusonDecision at all? Should there be any justice for #MikeBrown? Answer.
@RebeccaKearney7 Even if I wasnt black, do you think that means I shouldn't care about what happens to my fellow citizens? #FergusonDecision
@RebeccaKearney7 My mother is black. My father is white. But if you would like to explain my lineage to me a different way go ahead!
@RebeccaKearney7 you are astounding. Where are you from? Have you ever met anyone who is Black and who got along with you?
@RebeccaKearney7 you called me a moron but didn't answer my question. I laid it out pretty clearly. Do you think #MikeBrown deserved to die?
RT @TheBlackVoice: "To be a Negro in this country and to be relatively conscious is to be in a rage almost all the time." -James Baldwin ht‚Ä¶
@RebeccaKearney7 #Ferguson Hello again! Do you really think #MikeBrown deserved to die? I'm hearing that from your tone #FergusonDecision
@RebeccaKearney7 Haha I will! It's lovely given my sardonic sense of humor that you read what I said and chose to ignore your ignorance.
Racism is alive and well. Nestled between many Americans' passiveness and their white privilege. Dont be offended if I point it out. Change.
@RebeccaKearney7 Your silence speaks wonders. Try fighting for the side of justice and equality instead of against us. You'll be less hated.
Think, @RebeccaKearney7, think about what you just said. "Christ, it happened." Deaths of young Black men just happen is that how it is? No.
@RebeccaKearney7 My god how were you raised? You think the death of #MikeBrown deserves nothing more than passive acknowledgement?
@RebeccaKearney7 I don't advocate violence. I advocate change. I advocate being depressed when this country submits to its most bigoted.
@RebeccaKearney7 I'm a moron? A moron? I cry out because a boy died at the hands of a police officer for no reason and I need to get a clue?
@ShaunKing it feels like there is no end to how brutally we Blacks are treated because so many feel some need to keep us from change
@ShaunKing I can't feel safe in my country when my fellow americans defend this man
What can we do to stop this? What really can we do? #FergusonDecision
We don't get an out because someone will tell us we've gotten enough. Or it's not that bad. Well, it's the worst thing you can't imagine.
We don't get one.
There's an escape route in most disasters. The hurricane subsides. The wave passes. The movie goes to credits. There is no end for Blacks.
It's that simple. Blacks don't get a say. That's what I'm hearing from all sides and that's how it's going to be in the country. Shame.
Our president looks like we all feel. So many republicans will never let us pursue justice. Never. They won't let him because he's black.
How beautiful would it be if we woke up tomorrow and this was all a bad dream? #FergusonDecision (Blacks have been saying that for decades)
But we'll go about our daily routine. We've done it for about a century now. After all, if we don't, behind bars or 6 feet under in no time.
@BarackObama They're not going to listen to you. They're fine with Blacks dying. They always have been. Who? That jury and those like them.
Every horror story plunges white people into a world of constant danger and the possibility of sudden death at any turn. Sounds familiar.
Can you see what is happening? Has been happening for 400 years? We can never win. Someone is going to hate us and they will be protected.
How many Black people will die tonight at the hands of those who have sworn to protect? As many as our racist system intended. #Ferguson
... but there seem to be less and less people interested in curtailing bigotry. And more and more leaping to defend it. #Ferguson
The worst part is, checks and balances exist to stop this from happening. Someone steps in at some point to keep bigotry at bay. But...
The odds. are never. in our. favor. #Ferguson
Just saw viral marketing interrupt the #Ferguson feed, but how appropriate: "The Odds Are Never In Our Favor"
I hear people listing reasons why Black lives deserve to be taken every day. Can you see that no one deserves death? No one. #Ferguson
I don't care if #MikeBrown did worse than stick his hand in a car. He was 18. &amp; was shot at 12 times and died for no reason. Evil #Ferguson
I heard from a DCPS officer that if #MikeBrown did provoke Wilson, he deserved to be gunned down. These are the people who "protect" us.
I am so fortunate to live where the likelihood of gun violence against me is very very low. But in the eyes of the cops I don't know anymore
I know I can't have my hood up. I'll get shot. If I have it down they might see my afro and assume I'm a delinquent. And I'll get shot.
I don't know how the world works. But I do know I can't walk down the street without the fear I could get shot or arrested for nothing.
Who thinks this way? Who defends this man without even giving the side of the dead boy a chance? I find it hard to stop short of saying evil
Are you afraid of telling a white man he can't kill black people? Or of the idea that you might be administering justice for blacks? Shame.
Great. It's nice of recent news to let us know that being black really does mean your life doesn't matter. America, home of the free.

#Gandhi is great, but the underlying music in many of the scenes is far too manipulative and often unnecessary. Not great in that respect.
#Gandhi definitely borrows a lot from Lawrence of Arabia, but it's still a fantastic film. Though it does at times succumb to biopic clich√©s
The massacre at Amritsar in #Gandhi may be one of the most sickening moments I've ever seen in a film. It's a brilliantly crafted scene.
#BenKingsley in #Gandhi is one of those "of course he won the Best Actor #Oscar" performances
Oh my god #DanielDayLewis is in #Gandhi.
Watching the 3+ hour #Gandhi for the 2nd time, I was skeptical at first but I'd forgotten how great it actually is. #benkingsley is great.

@hitRECordJoe Great job in TDKR. John Blake was my favorite part of the movie. I'd love to see you don the cowl :)
@edshow Ann Romney didn't make it to the Olympics. The horse did. She didn't do anything. I'd rather vote for that horse.
@edshow Chris Nolan wasn't making Bane like Romney. Romney was the Joker.
@edshow What amazes me is how does Mitt manage to piss off EVERYBODY?
@edshow I love Brian Williams' face. You can tell he thinks Mitt is insane. And he's right.
@edshow Romney should just publish a book of apologies once he shuts his campaign-destroying mouth.
@edshow Soon the Romney crew will be saying they don't have the facts to back their claims up. #CainforVP
@edshow Oh yeah he failed his audition. And he's definitely not on the callback list. #edshow
@edshow How could Mitt write that stuff in his book? He has no idea that he actually needs people to like him.
@edshow I hope Mitt just keeps talking. Obama's guaranteed the presidency.
@edshow Well I'm glad Romney's digging himself deeper and deeper making himself look bad, even across the pond!
So excited. More than I've ever been for a movie. http://t.co/Ut0X22Bd @GetGlue #TheDarkKnightRises
