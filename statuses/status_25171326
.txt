@bengoertzel Well Ben, you're very Centaur like... so don't give up on that wish. You can make it happen in a couple more decades for real.
@bengoertzel Yes, wheels for example are preferable over long distances on flat terrain, but would you replace your legs with wheels?
@bengoertzel Yes, it's the uncanny valley of natural human like locomotion!
@bengoertzel Alright... agreed! But I do think it will be moot in a few years. 2 legged locomotion will be so good it won't be an issue.
@bengoertzel Biological evolution selected humans that stood up on their legs. Technological evolution will select robots that can stand up.
@bengoertzel The world is designed around bipedal humans not 4 legged dogs. We need 2 legged robots to take advantage of our bipedal world.
@bengoertzel But wheels won't get domestic-bots up steps, in the car, or on the roof to adjust the aerial.
@bengoertzel A bipedal robot would fulfill the killer app, that of pesky human chore. Once robots can do that they'll be cheap, ubiquitous.
