@TSAmedia_RossF thank you for this info. I guess that means I also need to file a complaint with United.
@TSAmedia_RossF thank you for taking the time to address this matter on this platform.
@TSAmedia_RossF unfortunately having it happen 2 today is just unacceptable.I'm flying united-terminal 7. I'm filing an official complaint.
@TSAmedia_RossF in both cases I was appalled at these women's tone of voice &amp; behavior. It's outrageous that that's how TSA treats travelers
@TSAmedia_RossF @TSA I'm a seasoned traveler and I am ALWAYS courteous and polite to TSA and crew members &amp; I have never felt so mistreated
@TSAmedia_RossF @TSA mind you I'm in line. When I suggested using my phone pass she spat her response at me of yeah WHY don't you do that?!
@TSAmedia_RossF @TSA I was spoken to in a disgusting and rude matter that my boarding pass print out was too small and I'd have to reprint
@TSAmedia_RossF @TSA because I was carrying a plastic bag along with my carry on items. And then when I was going thru the first id check
@TSAmedia_RossF @TSA @LAX I was mistreated twice by two different TSA members. First when I was getting in line and was repeatedly yelled
The @TSA customer service @LAX is so awful we should let terrorists handle it. At least they wouldn't be so abysmally rude &amp; disrespectful
