@DavidJdro a limited flood, however, is more credible an argument.
@DavidJdro unlikely. "The fountains of the deep" does make it dramatic. As far as I know, no geologists find evidence of a world-wide flood.
@DavidJdro yes obviously. Yet more likely than not, the Tigris and Euphrates and Mesopotamia. Those babies swelled like mad
