'The Voice'  New judges line up is fantastic. New hosts were a vast improvement. The show seemed slicker. The highlight was easily Kylie.
@TheDurgan any good?
TONIGHT: 'Tubular Bells: The Mike Oldfield Story' BBC4 at 23:00.
@TheDurgan is it on over here? I Don't DL tv shows. If I don't get screener, I prefer to wait for broadcast.
@jonnyroadley I find that way too much lately. Why make characters with no depth, it's getting frustrating.
@TheDurgan I fluctuate with Five-O, dint like O'Loughlin, but it's entertaining fodder.
I take back my recommendation of 'Hostages' being told it fades after the first episode to simply 'it's shit'.
@TheDurgan I liked it, but being told that it gets worse..
@jonnyroadley Urgh, it is on Channel 4, so going on the past history of us imports on there I Should have known.
@jonnyroadley Really? I'm 3 in, I like it so far..

Great news that 'Game of Thrones' is back 7th April on Sky Atlantic.
So, Boardwalk Empire is to finish after the next series. Drama at its finest. A bold move to end it, although it saddens me I applaud it.
Eastenders is a joke. Crap acting, rubbish characters &amp; dreadful storylines. Time to give up again..

With the disappointment that is the below average 'The Tunnel' UK TV makers are lagging so far behind the US that it's getting embarrassing.
Usually brilliant BBC2 having a bad time of it lately, 'Peeky Blinders' stalled after episode 1 &amp; the unfunny 'The Wrong Man's' is dire.

TONIGHT: 'MFL: Monday Night Football' comes to British Eurosport 2 from 00:00 with a double header. Redskins/Eagles Chargers/Texans

TONIGHT: Best show on at the moment,  TV masterclass in 'The Newsroom' on @skyatlantic at 21:00.
@MichaelJBerry8 I seem to remember a rant tweet from you when they did that. I just buy the games and never play them.
@MichaelJBerry8 I watch Lovefilm more than Netflix, better TV. Pointless watching either for movies, they are so old.
Just had an email from LOVEFILM to advise they will be showing 'Copper' exclusively. It's a not bad show, not great. But does improve.
Love Cruz, let's get him to salsa a bit more. #NFL #GIANTS

@MichaelJBerry8 that's 3 more than me, I have nothing from ITV on mine and I'm proud of that fact.
@MichaelJBerry8 couldn't agree more. If it's not Cowell, it's Ant &amp; Dec and at some points it's both at the same time. Gutter.

@struttermouse think they thought it was an easy game. Hated the way you set up with everyone in there own half, so boring to watch.
@struttermouse forgot to write the second part of my reply, yes was a cracking result, can't be unhappy with that. City were rubbish...
Brilliant "@andyfpp: @TVjunkster I get the feeling Neville is sitting there thinking Carragher is not a threat to his position."
Jamie Carragher is talking very high and utter rubbish in MNF.

Just one day until 'The Newsroom' season two premier hits Sky on demand.

@Outlaw04 yeah, never a pen in a million years... down to 10 men now too.
@Outlaw04 just seen the goal, not great defending. A draw would be quality for you.
@MichaelJBerry8 ha ha very true.. it was quite a shambles, better than ESPNs coverage but no sky sports.
@MichaelJBerry8 it's good isn't it, nice studio and decent coverage.
Rebecca Lowe ex ESPN pitchside reporter now main anchor on NBC's EPL coverage in the States. Ray Stubbs now BT's pitchside reporter.
@Outlaw04 Cracking match ours. Great first half, right up for it. Hope it keeps up this pace.. could go either way.
@Outlaw04 bloody love it.
@Outlaw04 Don't you think you can win the league this year. What with your super confidence? Ha
@Outlaw04 shit that's not a good start. Always a struggle with nerves on first game in the premier league. Long way to go...
@Outlaw04 hows your boys playing so far?.. our game is a feisty little number so far..
@MichaelJBerry8 Oh right, that's not good. Twitter during the match makes me so angry.

@Outlaw04 Im not 100% sure. I think you will just about stay up.
Build up of @Btsport coverage has been very nervy, but slightly better than espn did. Even with the dodgy panel.
@Outlaw04 airway you should be able to watch it online live.  #bloooooobirds
The studio sound on @BTSport is very dull, my sound system boomed when I switched over to @SkySports. Hope it improves when the match starts
I think the coverage from @BTSport so far is OK but why must they talk to us as if we have never seen football before.
BTsport theme for their premier league coverage is a lackluster rerecording of Come Together by primal scream, who perform it live today.

@peterbuzzard go for it #OnlyTheTruthAnyway
@jonnyroadley we are thinking only shows that are now over can be included. So we can see them as a whole unit.
@MichaelJBerry8   comedy is allowed
@Mardy_Mark   game of Thrones is right up there, maybe too early to say. first few seasons of true blood would have but now its terrible.
@Mardy_Mark  penultimate season of the sopranos is the worst, but such ground breaking TV, still is the show that others are judged on.
@Mardy_Mark that has been talked about a lot, keeps coming back to dodgy 2nd season. But I'll put it back in the pot, has to be considered.

@MichaelJBerry8   We have walking dead right up there, it's the main discussion. I think it could be.
@MichaelJBerry8 Lost Is one that's a perfect example, they say it was amazing but the final episode spoilt it for them.
@MichaelJBerry8 They are bubbling, but I think shows should have ended to see the whole picture. The Walking Dead shouldn't be in there yet.
