@WifeofanIronman Were both WFH as its just crazy outside still. Did you get back from Wales or are you still there?
This morning : Woke at 6, looked outside, street/cars buried in snow, txt work, went back to bed. This snow is fully into "Annoying" now...

Looking at the snow still falling outside, doesn't bode well for work tomorrow....
