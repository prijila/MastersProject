Just got back from the J. W. Waterhouse and Royal Academy Summer exhibitions, both fantastic and a bright spark on such a dull wet day.
What a day - fell down a pothole and pulled muscle at the top of leg. I now have a very painful bottom!!! Advice for cures needed urgently.
What! No rain - how long can this last? Off to push leaflets through doors in search of fame and fortune - still tasting Indian food:D
Indian food really hits the spot:-)
Another rainy day - the delights of an English summer. makes one want to run round the garden naked and frighten the ducks!!!!!
Such is life - done lots and nothing to say or show :-( All rather worrying really. Want to say but cannot say!
@GGAlert Many thanks for your tips. They have been really good. So far I am running at a profit!!!!!!
Coffee without biscuits - the world is crumbling, falling apart! There is no hope for man/womankind - we are all doomed - the end is nigh.
I am so so bored. Suggestions please of what to do on a damp Sunday evening.
2day is a rather flat day, but I did have some very good news that made all the difference. Ring someone you have not spoken to for  while.
Late to bed - early to rise males a man knackered! It is 6.30 on a Sunday.
#FollowFriday @RainforestSOS, @ecoactions all good causes and good sources of information.
The gasman is here 4 the annual boiler check - what an exciting life!! Then I am waiting for a strimmer to be delivered and 2 compost bins!
What a surprise! Great to see Ian - I rang and he was on the local station. There he was sporting a glorious ginger beard - what can I say:D
Hey - not raining at this moment. Perhaps I should venture out for a lunch I am looking forward to and Harry P tonight - what a good day.

Off to clear the path of weeds - usually, life does not get that exciting! Let me know the most boring thing you did today:D
I have not seen tonight's episode of #Torchwood. Do not spoil the plot for me.
Either rain properly so I can stop gardening; or stop raining so I can get on. At the moment I am like the man in a bloody cuckoo clock!

Starting back to  Oxford soon. The drive is a real pain, but good to have seen Ian and Janice.
Potter Heigham is the centre of the universe (or so they tell me!).
A very long drive to Norfolk. There was what looked like a nasty accident on the M25 and so long tail-backs. I hope no-one was hurt.
Off to see Ian and Janice, so long drive ahead.......
Just seen "Last Chance Harvey". Quite a sweet film. Boy finds girl, boy loses girl, boy finds girl - usual stuff but well acted.
@stephenfry - a great ISIHAC, it is good to hear it again. Many thanks.
Tonight dinner with Cate and Ray - long time no see.
Another sunny day - the garden calls. I missed the Reith lecture this morning, so I will listen to the podcast as I potter around!
In Redditch with Ian and Neil - off to see Terminator Salvation!!!!!
Went to Bristol and back to pick up Will's stuff! Off to Redditch tomorrow -- Yipee!
Finished lunch but not the Su Doku! Lunch good, everyone enjoyed it; Su Doku hard cheese, best nibbled with a glass of port.
People for lunch, so better get busy. Soup, goat's cheese tart to make, but first the Su Duko - sad but true.
The bus has an Internet connection, so I am able to twitter while I  twavel. I do love technology.
Sun out, meeting at the Linnean Soc - The House of Lords Science and Technology Committee Reports on Systematics and Taxonomy - fun!
@NeilHigton - go home and see you on Sunday.
Why is it that the pile of washing up "grows" during the night?
@stephenfry is the word Gravid?
@alandavies1 How about donating it to your local Primary School. They will love it and you - job done:-)
Make sure you listen to the Reith Lectures this year http://is.gd/Ut5i also follow it on Twitter @Reith2009 - Sandel talks such good sense
Walking across Dartmoor very wet, but the PowerMills Bunkhouse a very good place to stay. Excellent w/e good to catch up with friends.
Found this on Stephen Fry's tweet http://frog.rainforestsos.org/ great fun.
Off walking this weekend.... where has the sun gone?
@neilhigton make sure that you sit on the blunt end!
Do not forget to vote today - you cannot say that the EU is undemocratic if you do not vote.
Just got back from a walk round Farmoor Reservoir. Saw a barn owl, scaups, greylags, coots, mallards, moorhens - feel quite like Bill Oddie!
Take a look at http://tinyurl.com/m3c44v - looks fun!
@NeilHigton - another splendid day!
Off to Wytham Woods a wonderful place.
@NeilHigton - still a sunny day and all  I have done is housework:-( I hope that you are having a more productive and interesting time
BBC iPlayer - a fantastic invention. Just listened to Saturday Play: The Complete Smiley - A Murder of Quality.

Chimney Meadows Nature Reserve - a must place to visit. Make sure that you do!!! (If  you like that sort of thing!)
@NeilHigton - how goes it on this sunny day?
Back to sit in the sun with a beer. Nothing beats an English summer.
Off Into Oxford. Not nice on a Saturday as it is all too crowded, but M&S calls. I need new underwear!
Saw Eric Clapton last night at The Albert Hall. Fantastic evening.
Making soup is more interesting
Read lots of interesting activities that others are doing. Washing the      kitchen floor is not that interesting it seems!
