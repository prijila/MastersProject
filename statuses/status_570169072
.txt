I never noticed it before but in the episode 'Anasazi' (X-files), mulder's dad is drinking a big ol' glass of scotch! Damn it Krycek!

Dont worry Hollywood. Ryan Goslings will make money this weekend. Focus your efforts on Boston and not on violence that is created from hate
What the news/ networks need to NOT do is put a commercial on about violence and guns and death while Boston is happening.

Any recipe that calls for the "sweet delicious tartness" of the green hell-beast, the Granny Smith, will be substituted with bacon. Fact!
But those Granny Smith apples can go fuck themselves!
I love apples. Apple sauce. Apple juice. Cider. Hard cider. I used to work at an orchard. I think I was an apple in a previous life....
Mmmm. Breakfast is my favorite food group.
