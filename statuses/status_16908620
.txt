RT @gavintoms: @kimptoc Leisure firms hate swim clubs until a top swimmer gains recognition when they can't do enough to help/take credit.
Wonder if anyone has done a @neo4j docset for the @Dash app yet?
@gavintoms yes, thats what the a Saxon rep said at the meeting.  The 'management' did try to blame them before the rep spoke up :)
@gavintoms good point - thats why I tried to ensure there was no one in shot. And that window is asking for trouble :(
@gavintoms @GlassMillCentre was another told on the phone that pool would be open until 6, 5.45 at reception, 5.30 poolside-due to gala at 7
@gavintoms @GlassMillCentre ok, was a bit tongue in cheek -following comments raised in users forum about the pool utilisation :)
@GlassMillCentre no problem - I wonder if @Fusion_LS will be publishing minutes (and actions :) ) or similar from the meeting. hope they do.
@kapeli great - signed up for the beta programme ;)
@kapeli any plans for an iOS dash app?  I'd buy it :)
Back from interesting @GlassMillCentre user forum, had to leave early, been an hour &amp; looked like it could last another - lots of concerns
